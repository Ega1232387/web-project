[#FF0000]This is a TEMP event!\nTo be finished later.[#000000]
What the...
I can hear voices\nin my head!
What just\nhappened?
And where'd this\npin come from?
Hmm...
Wonder if there's\na connection...
Voices!\nDefinitely voices!
But why?
Am I\nhearing people's\nthoughts!?
What the hell\nIS this pin?
Huh?\nWhose phone?
Mine?
\x22Reach 104.\nYou have 60 minutes.
\x22Fail, and face erasure.\n--The Reapers\x22
Oh, that's cute.
See ya, spam.\nDeleted.
Huh?
Still there...
It's like the junk\nmail from hell.
Oww!\nMy hand...
F...frogs!?
Oww!\nWhat the...
They attacked me!
What do they\nwant with me?
D-down, froggie...
...Ungh!
What the hell\nis going on!?
Somebody!\nHelp!
Hey...\nEverybody stop\nignoring me!
What is\nthis place...
Crap!
I gotta run!
Man, here we\ngo again...
Stop whining.\nWe haven't had work\nin, like, forever.
Exactly.\nIt feels like the\nMonday after\nvacation.
You'd prefer\na permanent\nvacation?
Day 1 has the\nmost Players.\nNow's our chance\nto rack up some\npoints!
How else you\ngonna make up\nfor last month?
Aight, aight...\nOne week won't kill\nme. Probably.
Hey, while\nwe're at it...
How 'bout we\nplay a little game?
A gaaame?
Yeah, so it\ndoesn't feel so much\nlike work. C'mon,\nyou love it.
Oh, yeah.\nYou know me.
Sigh...\nAll right.
What's the\ngame?
How 'bout\nReaper Sport 3,\na Player Hunt?
Let's see who\nbags the most\nPlayers during\ntoday's mission.
Are you joking?\nThat's no fun\nat all!
You don't\nlike it?
But I'm gonna\ncrush you! There's\nno contest!
Ohh, zing!
Now I have\nto actually try.
You know the drill.\nLoser buys winner a\nhot bowl of ramen.
Huff, huff...
Should be...\nsafe...here...
Rrgh...\nFreakin' frogs!
Just leave\nme alone!
I didn't do\nanything to you!
They vanished!\nWhy are people\ndisappearing!?
What's\nhappening...
Why am I\neven here?\nWhat the hell!
They're gonna\nget me...
Found one!
Huh?
You!\nForge a [#FF0000]pact[#000000]\nwith me!
Uhh... I've kinda\ngot my hands full...
Listen!\nIf we forge a\npact, we can\nbeat the [#FF0000]Noise[#000000]!
Who cares\nabout a little\nnoise?
You wanna be\nerased? Hurry up!\nThere's no time!
Make a pact\nwith me! Please!
A-all right!
I accept.
What's with\nthe light show?
Here!
Use this [#FF0000]pin[#000000]!
But...the\nfunny lights...
I'll explain later!
Right now we\nhave to stop the\nNoise!
Uhh...\nOK?
Get ready!
That fire...
I did that!?
Whoa!\nYou can use\nthe pin?
You must be\nreally good at\n[#FF0000]psychs[#000000].
Guess I found\nthe right partner,\nhuh?
That's what you\ncall those flames?\nA psych?
Yup.
And now that\nwe've made a pact,\nthe Noise won't\ncome after us!
In other words,\nwe're safe.
Right.\nSee? All gone.
All gone.
So...what are\nNoise?
They're those\nmonsters we just\nfought. Duh.
Monsters?\nUh, sure...
And \x22psychs\x22?
Is that what\nthis pin is for?
Anyway, where\nare my manners?
My name's\nShiki Misaki.
Call me\nShiki.
I call this\nwack.
We've got a\nlong week ahead\nof us!
A week?\nWeek of what?
The [#FF0000]Reapers'\nGame[#000000] is seven days\nlong, right?
Reapers?\nExcuse me?
Who is this flake?
So what's\nyour name?
Forget her...\nWhere am I? How\ndid I get here?
C'mon, tell me\nyour name.
The sign says\n\x22Shibuya Station\x22...
Why am I\nin Shibuya?
Something\nwrong?
Wait...\nThe intersection.
I just need to\nretrace my steps.
Hey, whoa...\nWait for me!!!
Why are you\nfollowing me!?
Why are you\nmaking yourself so\nhard to follow?
Screw you.\nI go where\nI want.
Go where?
We're trapped\nin here!
What?\nDon't be\nstupid.
You're the one\nbeing stupid.
We made a pact.\nWe're supposed to\nstick together!
You can't beat\nthe Noise alone.
You can't\nsurvive!
Survive what?
The Game!\nDon't you wanna\nwin?
Pfft.\nPlay games on\nyour own time.
Hey!\nThat's not\nfunny!
They'll erase us\nif we don't win!
You saw what\nhappened to\nthose people!
You wanna\njoin them?
Besides, we're\npartners.
Partners\nwork together.
No way!\nDon't make me\na part of this.
You're already\na part of this.
You're a [#FF0000]Player[#000000],\njust like me.
A what?
I'm not\nplaying anything.
Oh yeah?
Then why do\nyou have a\nPlayer Pin?
Don't you have\na timer on your\nhand? I do...
What. The.\nHell.
See, you're part\nof the Reapers'\nGame, too.
......
We don't have\ntime for this!
The clock's\nticking! We've only\ngot 20 minutes!
Let's hurry\nto Ten-Four!
\x22Ten-Four\x22?
What's\nthat?
Ten-Four!\n104?
You got the\nmail, right?
\x22Reach 104 or\nface erasure.\x22
That junk\nmail...
Please.
What kind\nof nut would\nbelieve that?
Then again...
This day\nhas been pretty\nweird.
And she's\ngonna follow me\nanyway.
May as well go\nalong and try to\nfigure this out.
All right, you win.\nLead the way.
Good. Now,\nfor the last time...
Tell me\nyour name.
......
Neku.\nNeku Sakuraba.
Neku, huh?
Cute name.
Shut up.
All right, Neku.\nLet's get over\nto 104!
I told you!\nWe can't leave!
Oh, please.
Durff!
You gotta be\nkidding me!
Next time,\ntry listening.
So this is all\npart of that\n\x22Reapers' Game\x22?
That's\nright.
This is\nnuts.
She's actually\ntelling the truth?
Then that means\nthe mail I got--
Neku! Move!\nWe have to get\nto Ten-Four!
Oww!
It's blocked!\nThere's no\nway past!
We can't\nget through!?
But this is\nthe way to\nTen-Four!
Why do I feel\nlike I'm being\nwatched?
That guy over\nthere. What's he\nstaring at?
......
Pact\nconfirmed.
What are we\ngonna do about\nthis wall?
Huh? Neku!\nIt's open.
What's up\nwith that?
No idea.\nA lucky break,\nI guess!
C'mon, we gotta\nkeep moving.
Something about\nthat guy in red...
Huh?\nWhere'd he go?
Weird.
Made it!
The timer\nvanished!
Whew!\nMission complete.
Pfft, big deal.
What!?
Only an idiot\nwould screw up\non Day 1.
Who's there!?
Oh, no...\nA Reaper?
Reaper...
You two are\ngonna get erased\nsooner or later.
So come on.\nHelp a girl out and\nearn me a few\nextra points, 'K?
Those monsters\nagain...
Neku, you know\nhow to fight now,\nright?
This time focus\nyour thoughts on\nme!
What?
Fight your\nown battles!
Please!\nTo stop the\nNoise!
...Fine.
Come on!
Good!\nNow we can\nfight together!
We can beat\nthe Noise faster\nas a team!
Let's do this!
Is it over?
Not yet, Neku!\nOver there!
Whew...\nThis one looks\ntough.
...Like I've\ngot a choice.
Hey!\nStalker!
I'm not a\nstalker!
Whatever.\nJust...
Don't mess\nthis up!
I...I won't!
Whew...\nWe did it...
But you\nheard her...\nDay 1 is nothing.
What if the\nmissions only\nget harder?
We've got\nsix more days...
Are we gonna\nmake it?
I...I don't\nwant to be\nerased...
I can't believe\nthis...
Why am I\nstuck here?
What if I'm\nerased!?
What the\nhell kind of\ngame is this?
This can't\nbe right.
Gaaah!
I'm really\nstuck here?\nIn Shibuya!?
Nngh...
Where am\nI now?
...I hope this\nworks out.
Hey!
Aaack!\nDon't scare me\nlike that!
Grow up.
You're\nobnoxious...
Umm...\nIs something\nwrong?
Where are we?
Isn't this the\nunderpass by\nthe station?
I can hear\nthe trains.
That's\nweird.
How'd we\nget here?
There's the\nmission!
\x22Set the cursed\nsculpture free.
\x22You have 60 minutes.\nFail, and face erasure.\n--The Reapers\x22
Oww!
Timer's back.
What's it\nfor?
The mission.
...You really\ndon't know?
If we don't\nclear the mission\nbefore the timer\nhits zero,
we'll both\nbe erased!
Sounds\ncrazy to me.
But...\nmaybe not\nthat crazy.
I saw it happen\nto those people\nby the station.
And met a\nReaper.
...I can't\nbelieve I'm even\nentertaining that\nthought.
But I\nknow what\nI heard.
...Wait.
Why'd the\ndate change on\nmy phone?
A day must\nhave gone by.
What!?
I think we\nfell asleep after\nthe mission.
But that's OK.\nWe need to\nfocus on today!
Have you\nlost your\nMIND?
It's anything\nbut OK!
We were\nin the middle\nof the street,
in broad\ndaylight!
Why would we\nfall asleep!?
So...\nthis \x22cursed\nsculpture\x22--
it's gotta be\ntalking about\nthe statue of\nHachiko.
Maybe we\npassed out.
And then...\nwoke up here?
Everything\nin between is\na blank.
But then\nwhat's the curse?\n...Neku?
Did somebody\ndrag us here?\nOr--
C'mon, Neku,\npay attention!
......
Hey! What,\nnow you're\nignoring me?
If we don't\nwork together,\nwe'll fail the\nmission!
......
You don't\nhave to be\nlike this.
Sigh...\nWhat am I\ndoing wrong?
......
All right!\nNo point in\nstanding here.
Let's go\nfind Hachiko.
Oww!
What?\nAnother wall!?
So now\nwe're trapped\nin here.
No...\nWe'll never finish\nthe mission now.
All she ever\ndoes is whine...
...Why not?
Because this\nis the way to\nHachiko.
Then we\nhave to get\nthrough.
We got\npast the wall\nyesterday.
Is there some\nkind of rule?
What should\nwe do?
......
Don't just stand\nthere. Think of\nsomething!
I AM thinking.\nMaybe if for just\none minute
you could\nstop your bi--
Huh?
Neku,\nwhat is it?
......
That guy in\nthe red hoodie.\nI've seen him\nbefore.
Neku.\nWhat are you\nlooking at?
That guy...\nYou know him?
I remember...\nHe was at the\ncrossing yesterday,\nby the wall.
Who is he?\nI'm gonna try\nreading his mind.
Hmph.
What is it?
I can't read him.
What!?\nYou can't\nscan him?
I had no\ntrouble scanning\npeople yesterday.
Maybe the\nrules changed?
Or maybe the\npin is broken.
Can we finish\nthe mission\nwithout being\nable to scan?
Hmm...\nWhat if it's\njust him?
Maybe he's\nspecial.
Neku!
Ugh...
What now!?
That guy is\ncoming right\ntoward us!
You.\nScan and erase\nall the Noise in\nthis area.
Huh?\nWhat are you\ntalking about?
Are those\nthe conditions\nto move on?
I don't see\nany Noise!
The world is\nmore than just\nwhat you see.
He left.
What a\ncreepy guy.
I don't\nknow what\nhis deal is...
But he's part\nof the Game,\nthat's for sure.
Which can\nmean only\none thing.
Interesting...\nHis kind can't\nbe scanned?
......
\x22The world is\nmore than just\nwhat you see.\x22
So to find\nthe Noise...
Hey.\nLet's get rid\nof the Noise.
How?
They're not\nhere!
Yes they are.\nWe have to\nscan for them.
You think?
All right!\nLet's try it.
But first...
I meant to\nask you.
Shouldn't you\ntry some other\npins?
You've got\nmore, right?
Pins?
Yeah!\nThey should've\ngiven you a\nwhole bunch.
You're right...\nIn my pocket.
Why not\ntest them\nout?
How?
Remember\nthe flame pin\nyesterday?
This one?
Well,\nI wasn't able\nto use it.
So maybe--
I get it.\nCertain pins only\nwork for certain\npeople.
I've got to\ntry them all\nand see.
...Talk about\na hassle.
All right,\nlet's see what\nI can do.
You were right.\nWe have to scan\nto see the Noise.
That takes\ncare of them all.
Objective\nmet.
But what\nabout the wall?\nIt's still--
Huh!?
It's gone!\nWhy?
Because we\ntook out the\nNoise.
So that's the\ntrick to getting\npast the walls.
But...\nthat's odd.
What's\nodd?
I heard you\ncan only beat the\nNoise in pairs.
But I\nmanaged just\nfine alone.
Hmm,\nme too...
So how did\nwe do it?
You have\na pact.
Huh?
That's the only\nreason you can\nhurt the Noise.
Without each\nother, you'd be\nhelpless.
Wait, but--
What is with\nthat guy?
He knows\ntoo much...
He must be\none of them.
Well, anyway...\nYou did great.
What?
You were\nable to use all\nthe pins!
So?
You're like\nsome kind of\npsych genius!
Come on.
Using a couple\npins doesn't make\nanyone a genius.
Don't be\nnaïve.
The bigger\nquestion...
is where\nthese came\nfrom.
Huh?
Neku.\nYou have two\nPlayer Pins.
So?
So why\ntwo?
You only\nneed one.
How should\nI know?
Why do I\nhave any of\nthem?
I need\nthem for\npsychs,
so I can stop\nthe Noise from\nkilling me.
But how'd\nI get 'em?
Well, umm...
Two is better\nthan one!
So, like,\ndon't feel bad!
You're the one\nwho said I only\nneed one...
Think how\nlucky I am!
My partner's\na psych whiz.
A genius!\nYou're a genius,\nNeku!
I'd never make\nit without you!
If you're going to\nflatter someone...
you could try\nto sound a little\ngenuine.
Neku,\nyou listening?
......
Stop that.\nI'm just trying\nto be nice.
I'm listening.
Well, how am\nI supposed to tell\nwhen you just\nstand there?
You should\ntake off those\nheadphones.
It's rude.
Would you shut\nthe hell up!
I just met you.\nI don't like you.
And I don't\ngive a rat's ass if\nyou think I'm rude!
You don't\nhave to yell...
What am I\ngoing to do?
Now she's playing\nwith her phone?\nForget this.
Hey!\nWait up!
Neku...\nStop!\nWait for me!
Where are\nyou going?\nI'm your partner!
...Gotchu punks\nnow.
Wha--\nWho's there!?
You got us\ngood yesterday,
but today\nI'ma crush\nyou, yo!
Um...what?\nYou've got the\nwrong person.
Neku, you\nknow this guy?
Don't\ninsult me.
Need a hint?\nGo ask your\nfriends.
\x22Friends\x22?\nWhat are you\ntalking about?
Shut up, yo!\nYou ain't\nfoolin' me!
I can't\nscan you.\nYou gotta be\nwiddem!
You can't\noutsmart me,\nyo.
Wait!\nJust--
Beat! Stop it!
They're not\nReapers!
They're Players,\njust like us.
What?
See?\nThey've got\nPlayer Pins.
Players must\nnot be able to\nscan each other.
Remember?
You couldn't\nscan me either.
......
Oh.
Yo, sorry I\njumped to\nconclusions...
No worries.\nYou just gave\nus a start.
Yesterday this\npink-haired chick\ncornered us
before we\ncould get to\n104.
Then Pinky\nsicked a buncha\nNoise on us...\nMessed us up\nbad, yo.
So that's why\nyou were out\nfor payback.
Yup.\n...Hey, hold up.\nWe should do\nintroductions.
The name's Beat.\nAnd this is my...
my partner,\nRhyme.
Hello!
Hi!\nI'm Shiki.
That over\nthere's Neku.
He's my\npartner.
......
Wha's with\nthe phones?\nHe still mad?
No...he's\njust Neku.\nDon't feel\nbad.
...Hey,\nI know!
Lemme give\nyou a tip to\nmake up for\njumpin' yas.
You figure out\nhow to use your\nphones yet?
You mean our\ncell phones?
Well...\nwe don't get\nany calls...
Sending\nmessages doesn't\nwork either.
All we do with\nours is check the\nmission mail.
Why?\nDo they do\nanything else?
We played around\na bit and found\nsome things--
Whoa, you\nmean you ain't\nusin' yours?
You two gonna\nget owned down\nthe road, yo!
Umm...\nI guess...
It's cool!\nYou two got\nquestions, you\nask us.
Gotta put our\nheads together,\nyou feel me?
So about\nthe phone...
Yeah.\nYou can use\nit to pick out\nyour pins.
Pick them\nout?
How?
Well...
Why don't\nyou take this\npin?
Then you can\ntry it out!
We can\nkeep it?
Sure.\nWe had\nextras.
Wow!\nThanks!
Touch the\ncell phone in the\nupper right corner\nof the screen!
So we can\nuse the phone...
to pick out\npins, right?
Uh-huh!
Those are\nthe pins you\nuse in combat.
Cool.
You should\nuse that pin\nI gave you...
and try\nit out for\nyourself.
We will.\nThanks!
So who's this\ngirl with the\npink hair?
Heh,\nthat cow?
She attacked us\nin the scramble\ncrossing.
Those\nblack wings...\nShe's prob'ly\na Reaper.
Yeah,\nwe couldn't\nscan her.
So, it\ndoesn't work\non Reapers...
Or on\nother Players,\napparently.
Guess we\nfound that out\nthe hard way.
Sorry...
So if she's\na Reaper,
does that\nmean she\ngives out the\nmissions?
Who knows...
Yo, that\nreminds me--
'sup with\ntoday's\nmission?
It don't\nmake sense.
Yeah,\nabout that...
What's your\ntake on the\nmission?
The cursed\nsculpture or\nwhatever?
It's gotta\nbe Hachiko.
Yeah!\nThat's just\nwhat I said!
But what's\nthe curse?
Hmm...\nYou got me.
We should\nprobably start by\nheading that way.
Can't.\nThere's a\nwall, yo.
Again?
What's up\nwith that?
We keep\nhitting these\ninvisible walls...
I think we\ntrapped in here,\nor somethin'.
I tried breakin'\nthe walls, and\nthey don't break.
But some\nyou can get\nthrough.
Hmm...
We noticed\nguys in red by\nthe walls we were\nable to pass.
Do you know\nanything about the\nReapers' Game?
Just that you\nhave to stay alive\nfor seven days.
And somethin'\nabout a new\nmission every\nday.
The Reapers\nsend them?
Gotta be.\nIt's their Game,\nright?
And if we\nfail the mission,\nthey erase us.
...Maybe not.
Really!?
Beat and I\nnever made it\nto 104.
But here\nwe are.
So like...
we don't\ngotta play?\nSweet!
It's too\nearly to say.
We should\ncarry out the\nmissions.
I don't want\nto find out what\nhappens if these\ntimers hit zero.
Do you?
Thankfully,\nours vanished\nyesterday before\ntime ran out.
Hmm...
Ours went\naway when we\ngot to 104.
Hey, you think\nyou and Neku\nfinishing the\nmission
might've got\nBeat and I\noff the hook?
Thanks\nfor all the\ninfo!
'Specially\nabout the\nphone!
That's\ngonna be a\nhuge help.
Heh heh.\nGood!\nAlways happy\nto help.
I feel\nready to take\non anything!
Yeah, well--\nyou might not\nwanna say\nthat.
Rhyme's thinkin'\nthings is gonna\nget tough.
Yo, we\nshould all work\ntogether!
They say two\nheads are better\nthan one.
And four\nhas to be better\nthan two!
Great idea!\nI am so in!
It'll be more\nfun that way.\nRight, Neku?
...Do what\nyou want.\nI work alone.
What!?\nNeku, you can't\nmean that!
Forget it.
I can't take\none more minute\nof your nagging.
I don't need a\nbunch of strangers\nbringing me down.
Neku!
How can\nyou say that?
Don't\nask me.
Maybe I'm\njust angry.
We're on\nyour si--
I can't\nscan you.\nYou could be\nPlayers...
or you could\nbe Reapers.\nI have no way\nof knowing.
But the\nPlayer Pins!
That's not\nenough.
Yo, Phones!
What the\nhell's your\nproblem!?
We just lookin'\nout for you,\nand you treat us\nlike this?
Don't get\nangry, Beat...
I can see\nwhere Neku's\ncoming from.
I shouldn't\nhave opened my\nbig mouth...
Aw,\nRhyme...
Rrgh...
You piece\na' DIRT!
Screw you!\nWe don't want\nyour help!
Le's bounce,\nRhyme.
Wait, no!\nWe're sorry!
...They left.
Nice going,\nNeku!
We should\nall stick together,\nand you know it!
Then why\ndon't you go\nwith them?
Listen to\nyourself...
We're\npartners,\nNeku.
But I don't\nunderstand you!
Let me in!\nTell me what\nyou're thinking!
Let yourself in.\nYou can scan me.
You know\nthat's impossible!
Besides, we're\nright here.\nLet's just talk\nto each other--
And say\nwhat?
I'm not\nopening up to\nanyone.\nEver.
Other people\njust hold me\nback.
I can do things\nmy own way.
N-Neku!
Sigh...
Tell me what\nI'm supposed to\ndo...
......
Another guy in red.\nWe must be headed\ntoward a--
Ouch!
A wall.
I knew it.
So...we just\nhave to defeat\nsome Noise,\nright?
She is so SLOW!\nDo I have to do\neverything?
Neku!\nWhere are you--
I know what\nyou are.
My terms:\nLift the statue's\ncurse.
You're a\nReaper.
I don't get\npaid to chitchat.\nPlay the Game.
Hmph.\nThat was a\nwaste of time.
Lift the\nstatue's curse,\nhuh?
That sounds\njust like the\nmission.
But Hachiko\nis PAST the\nwall...
Wait--
Neku...
Please,\nSTOP walking\noff without me!
Hey.
Arrgh!\nMy name is Shiki.
Can you say\n\x22Shiki\x22?
Hey, I see\nanother statue.
Oh yeah!\nThe Moyai!
Like Easter\nIsland? What's a\nMoai doing here?
\x22Moyai\x22!\nWith a Y!
Never thought\nabout where it\ncame from...
Think it's\ncursed?
I don't know.\nIt looks pretty\nnormal to me.
Let's\nfind out.
Objective\nmet.
So the Moyai\nwas possessed\nby Noise...
and we had\nto scan to\nfind it.
The guy\nin red...
Yup.\nHe's gone.
But we can\nprobably get\nthrough now.
We freed\nthe cursed\nsculpture.
Does that\nmean we cleared\nthe mission?
No, that\nwas just to\ncross the wall.
See?\nMy clock's\nstill ticking.
Yeah...\nMine, too.
Well, at least\nthe wall's gone.
Let's go find\nthis \x22Hachiko\x22...\nour real target.
Neku...
You talk like\nyou've never\nheard of it.
Nope.\nWhat's Hachiko?
WHAT!?
How can you\nlive in this\ncountry and not\nknow Hachiko?
......
Remember where\nwe met yesterday?\nThere's a statue of\na dog in the plaza.\nThat's Hachiko.
Now, I have\na question.
How'd you\nfigure out how\nto get past\nthe wall?
......
Not again...
......
All right!
Fine.\nLet's just head\nfor Hachiko.
......
That young\nlady...
She has just\nthe ingredient\nI need.
We made it!\nAnd with plenty\nof time left!
This is\nwhere we met\nyesterday...
So the two\nplaces are\nconnected.
OK! Let's lift\nHachiko's curse!
And how do\nyou propose\nwe do that?
Well...umm...
Maybe we\ncould erase the\nNoise around it,\nor...yeah.
She's clueless.
This is why\nI can't count on\nother people.
...They're all\nclueless.
No Noise\naround the\nstatue...
You tried\nscanning?
Then\nHachiko must\nnot be cursed.
Could we\nhave the wrong\nstatue?
Huh?\nHey, look, Neku!
Crap...\nWe don't have\ntime to hunt for\nanother statue...
EARTH TO\nNEKU!
What!
Something's\nwrong with\nHachiko.
Like what?
Hmm...\nI'm not sure.
But it looks\ndifferent from\nwhen I saw it\nat Hachi Fest.
Then let's\ntake a closer\nlook.
Ahh!\nWait!
There are\nconsequences\nto touching\nHachiko!
You don't\nsay.
Touch it, and\nyou might be\nwhisked off to\nanother dimension!
......
What the hell\nkind of half-assed\nurban legend\nis that?
...All right. Fine.\nI'll be careful.
But first we\nneed to do\nsome recon.
Hmm...\nSomething is\ndefinitely off.
When I\nsaw him at\nHachi Fest,
Hachiko\nwasn't like\nthis at all.
I should\nget a closer\nlook...
Be careful\nnot to touch it!
What's\nHachi Fest?
Oh, it's\na blast!
It's this\nfestival where\nyou touch Hachiko\nfor good luck!
If you touch\nthe right place\nin the right way,\nyour wishes\ncome true!
Wow.\nCharming.
They hold\nit every year.
And each time,\nthe place you\nhave to touch\nchanges.
But if you\nget it wrong...
...You explode?
You get\ncursed!
Hmm...
Sounds pretty\nextreme.
Hachi Fest\nis over,
but you\nshould still be\ncareful where\nyou touch.
So this\ncurse...
Umm...
I know\nsomething's\noff...
Well, you\njust take your\ntime.
Cause, you\nknow, we've got\nso much of it.
Meanwhile,\nI'm going to do\nsome recon.
What should\nwe do, Neku?
I might\nbe missing\nsomething...
I should\ngather more\ninfo.
Hey...
Neku, we\nshould try\nthat!
Try\nWHAT?
Polishing!\nHachiko did look\na little dirty.
And I saw\nthis weird marking\non him.
What if it\nwas some kind\nof hex?
Or what if\nsomeone just went\ncrazy with a\nmagic marker?
Well, if that's\nthe only lead\nwe've got...
All right.\nLet's try it.
Yeah!
OK, Neku!\nLet's polish like\nwe mean it!
Isn't that gonna...\nyou know...\ncreate a scene?
Don't worry!\nNo one's\nwatching.
And so\nwhat if they\nsee us?
See us\npetting a piece\nof ROCK?
All right.\nWhatever...
Grrr...
You say\nsomething,\nNeku?
Nope.
You know...
It seems\nthe more we\npolish...
the less\nthis looks like\nHachiko...
GRRRRR...
Stop growling\nand polish!
I'm not\ngrowling...
Neku, something\ncame out of the\nstatue!
Neku, we did it!\nThe timer's gone!
So, there was\nNoise possessing\nboth the Moyai\nAND Hachiko.
And our\nmission was to\nget rid of both.
Hey,\nNeku...
Yeah?
You said\nbefore you\ndon't need\nany friends.
Yeah.\nYour point?
Well, you\ncouldn't have\nsolved Hachiko's\nriddle without me.
What?\nGet real.
If I hadn't\nnoticed the\npattern,
we might\nnot have cleared\nthe mission.
Listen,\nStalker.
I don't need\nyou to solve one\nstupid riddle.
Riiight.
Well, if you\nask me--
Arrrgh!\nThis is soooooo\ninfuriating!
What...\nYou two again?
Huh!?
That voice...\nYou were at 104\nyesterday!
You're that\nReaper!
Well,\nexcuuuse me\nfor doing my\njob.
Then it's true?
A Reaper...
She gives\nout the\nmissions?
You know,\nyou owe me\na bowl of\nramen.
For not\ndisappearing\nlike you're\ns'posed to.
This...girl is\na Reaper?
What's wrong?\nToo spooked to\nanswer?
Well, this\nshould bring you\naround!
Huff...huff...
Nngh...\nThese Noise are\ntougher than the\nothers...
Wow.\nYou're, like,\nstronger than I\nthought.
But I'm not\ndone playing\nyet.
This next\nNoise will be\na killer.
No...
I can't keep\nthis up...
I've got\none chance.
Hmm?
I have to\ntake her out!
Please tell me\nyou're not planning\non fighting me?
Ha ha ha ha!
How stupid can\nyou get? You'll\nnever win against\na Reaper!
But all right.
I'm game.\nI was getting\nbored anyway.
What!?\nShe erased her\nown Noise?
You seem\nsurprised.
Aren't the\nNoise on your\nside?
Eww, gross!\nDon't group us\ntogether.
The Noise are\nnothing but tools.\nPawns.
Just like\nyou Players.
Ha ha!
Rrgh...\nI can't let this\nbrat win!
But can I\nstop her?
I have no\nidea how strong\nshe is...
Doesn't matter.\nI have to try!
Don't, Neku!
You don't\nwant to take\nher on!
She can\nerase you in\na second!\nOhh...
Hmph.
Aww, what?\nYou're giving\nup?
Booo-ring.
Don't get\nmy hopes up\nlike that.
Killjoy.
Now that I'm\nin the mood...
maybe I should\njust finish the job.
Huh!?
But...I can't\ndo that.
Huh?
Well, this is\na pickle...
Hmm...
I know!\nLet's try some-\nthing fun!
A special\nbonus challenge\njust for you!
If you pull it\noff, I'll let you\nout of the\nReapers' Game!
You...\nyou will?
You betcha!\nSweet deal, huh?
So, like,\nwhat do you\nsay?
A ticket\nout...
Neku, don't!\nDon't listen!
You back\nthere.\nShut up!
Now, are you in,\nor are you out?
...I'm in.
Neku!
Whee! 'Atta boy!\nNow, let's get\nstarted!
Oh, I forgot\nto mention.
If you fail...
I erase\nyou.
What!?
Thankfully,\nthe rules are\nveeery simple.
You have\none minute...
to erase\nthat girl.
What?
Erase her?
Yup.\nPoof! Kaput!\nEasy, right?
Just pretend\nyou're erasing\nthe Noise.
Whew, this\none's already\nin the bag.
All right.\nReady? Start!
W-wait!
Dammit...\nShe's asking me\nto kill someone.
There's no\nway I can do\nthat.
But if I\ndon't...
Neku...
30 seconds!
Still on\nthe fence?
Then let\nme give you\nan incentive.
That girl?\nShe's been\nspying for the\nReapers.
What?\nShe's a spy?
Hey!\nWhat are you\nsaying!
Thanks for\nchecking in so often.\nWe couldn't have\ndone it without you.
Shut up!\nDon't lie!
Neku...\nShe's making\nall of this--
Your\nphone.
Why did you\nkeep playing\nwith your phone?
Huh!?
Oh...\nI was...just...
Just SPYING.
She's not\nvery good at\ncovering it up.
I didn't spy!\nI swear!
G'bye.\nAnd thanks\nfor playing.
10 seconds...
You're the\nstar, kiddo.
Just do\nthings your\nway.
......
What are\nyou waiting for?
Do what\ncomes naturally.
Save yourself.\nScrew everybody\nelse, right?
Don't, Neku.\nDon't kill me...
I have to.
Nngh...
What is\nthis place?
It's dark...\nIs it nighttime?\nNo, I'm indoors.
Wait!\nThe girl!
......
She's gone.
Because\nof me...
......
I need to\nget out of\nhere.
Where's the\nexit?
If I use\nthis pin for\na light...
Huh?
It doesn't\nwork.
So I can't\nuse pins.
Oh, well.\nI'll just have\nto feel my way\naround.
Footsteps?
Somebody's\ncoming this\nway...
Ooh...
So dark...\nWhere am I?
Show\nyourself!
Ahhh!
You?
Neku!?
You scared\nthe crap out\nof me!
Don't do that.
I scared\nYOU?
Where the hell\nhave you been?
It was dark.\nI was looking\nfor a way out!
I must've\ntripped a half a\ndozen times.
Hmm, time to\ntry this again.
Neku, pins\nonly work when\nwe fight Noise.
Really?
Well...with a\nfew exceptions.
Like\npsychokinesis...
W-well...\nIt's dark.\nYou should be\nmore careful.
You kidding?\nI already found\nthe exit!
Then why\ndidn't you\nlea--
I'm not going\nanywhere without\nyou.
C'mon, I'm\nnot that useless,\nam I?
......
Don't do\nanything dumb\nlike wander off.
Excuse\nme?
Which one\nof us has been\nacting dumb?
......
What are\nyou waiting for?
Do what\ncomes naturally.
Save yourself.\nScrew everybody\nelse, right?
Don't, Neku.\nDon't kill me...
I have to.
Now, let's\nsee some\nresults!
Hey!\nThat's enuffa\nthat.
Who\nare you?
Ah-ah-ah,\nsister.\nYou gotta play\nby the rules.
Making \x22erase\nyour partner\x22 the\nmission is a clear\nviolation.
It is!?
I know that.
I was just\nhaving a little\npostgame fun.
What!?
One mission\nper day.\nThat's the rule.
And only the\nGame Master can\npick the missions.
I know\nthat, too!
But I'm not\nthe Game\nMaster.
Which MEANS\nthis wasn't a\nmission,
which MEANS\nI didn't break\nany rules!
Then start\nwalkin', sister.
Your work's\ndone for the day.
...Hmph.
For a\nPlayer...
you know a\nlot about our\nrules.
You...you\ntricked me!
All that about\nletting me out\nof the Game--
that was\nall a lie!
Like, that is\nso rude!\nI do not lie.
If I erased\nyou, that's still\nletting you out\nof the Game!
Ugh, you\ntotally ruined\nall my fun.
Time to\ncall it a day.
We can play\nsome more\nanother time.
Thank you\nso much.
We owe you\nour lives,\nMister...um...
Hanekoma.\nSanae Hanekoma.
Think of me\nas a sort of...\nguardian.
I watch\nthe Game,
to make\nsure shady types\ndon't start bendin'\nthe rules.
That Reaper\ntricked us.
You mean she\ntricked YOU.
You ignored\nthe young lady,\nfell into a\ntrap,
and very\nnearly snuffed\nher for good.
......
If you think you\ncan do everything\nyourself, you're in\nfor some hard\nlessons.
Now!\nApologize to\nthe young lady.
'Scuse me?
Hard feelings\ndon't make for\ngood teamwork.
You wanna\nsurvive or not?\nGo on!
......
...Sorry.
Neku...
I, um...\nF-forget it.\nI'm over it.
I mean, you\ndidn't... She made\nyou do it, right?
And I should've\nstood up for\nmyself better.
So let's just\nput it behind us.
There!\nProblem solved!
Now listen\nup, you two.
There's only\none way to\nstay alive in\nthis Shibuya.
Trust your\npartner!
Especially\nyou, Phones.
\x22Phones\x22?
You know\nwhat trust is,\nright?
Partnership\nis essential to\nsurviving the\nGame.
Alone,\nyou face\nlimitations.
But\npartner up,
and you can\nsmash right\nthrough them.
Same goes\nfor when you\nfight the Noise.
You may think\nyou're alone,\nbut you're not.
Your partner\nis always sharing\nyour energy.
So you gotta\nsync up and really\nfeel each other.
You won't\nsync up unless\nyou OPEN up.\nTalk to her!
Tell her how\nyou're feeling.\nLay it on her!
That's the\nfastest way to\nget something\nacross.
He's right,\nNeku!
Look...\nI know I hold\nyou back.
I'm not\nthat good at\npsychs...
But still!
I want to\nwin at this\nGame.
And I want\nus to do it\ntogether!
So tell me\nwhat you're\nthinking!
I just want\nto understand\nyou!
......
Neku?
I want to\nunderstand me,\ntoo...
But I don't.
What...
I can't remember\nanything but my\nname.
I woke up in\nthe intersection\nwith no clue how\nI got there,
no clue\nwhy I'm part\nof this stupid\nGame.
I don't know\nanything.
Because I\ncan't remember...\nanything.
But...
That means...\nwhat?
You have\namnesia?
......
Sorry to\nhear it, boss...\nThat's rough.
I can't believe\nyou've lost your\nmemory...
You could've\ntold me sooner.
I didn't know.
It did strike\nme as kind of\nstrange
that you\nknew nothing\nabout Shibuya\nor the Game.
What,
like you do?
Well, I don't know\nEVERYTHING, but...
Anyway.\nWe got lucky.
Thanks to\nMr. Hanekoma\nand his advice,
I feel like\nyou and I can\nfinally talk.
And he\ngave us that\nawesome pin!
Ahhh!
That almost\ngave me a\nheart attack!
Hey, you\ndropped your\nphone--
Ahh!\nDon't touch it!\nI got it!!!
Nice\nphoto.
...You looked?
The screen\nwas face up...
That's my\nfriend.
She was in\nmy class.
So all\nthose times--
Yeah.\nI was looking\nat this.
And you\nyell at me\nfor keeping\nsecrets!
It's just a\nphoto. You don't\nneed to--
Look, Neku!\nThe mission mail!
...Huh?
She's\ncovering?
What else\ndoes she have\nto hide?
\x22Defeat the\nmaster of\nA-East.
\x22You have 360\nminutes. Fail, and\nface erasure.\n--The Reapers\x22
The timer.
Guess we'd\nbetter get\nstarted.
OK!
Today's\nmission has\nsomething to do\nwith A-East.
A-East?
It's the name\nof a concert\nspace.
I've been\nthere a bunch\nof times.
You seem\nto know Shibuya\npretty well.
Of course!\nI hang out here\nall the time.
Follow me!\nI'll take you\nto A-East.
The exit's\nright over\nthere.
Wait a sec...
What now?
Umm...
We're here,\nheh heh...
You mean\nwe were inside\nA-East the\nwhole time?
You know--
How was I\nsupposed to\ntell?
They had\nall the lights off!
......
We're ahead\nof schedule, so\nno griping.
Now let's go\ndefeat that\nmaster!
Umm...\nonce we, um,\nfind it.
It was too\ndark to see\nanything inside.
Then we\nbetter take care\nof the lights.
Otherwise\nwe're more likely\nto trip over it\nthan defeat it.
How do we\nrestore power?
Somebody\naround here\nmust know...
Welcome.
Huh!?
I thought\nno one could\nsee us!
What, did you\nforget, Neku?
It's like\nMr. Hanekoma\nsaid.
Inside places\nwith that decal,
we become\nvisible so we\ncan do some\nshopping.
Oh yeah...
Tsk, the hell\nis he? We gotta\nrehearse.
What's that\nguy grumbling\nabout?
Hey, perfect!\nYou two.
Huh!?
Can we\nhelp you?
H-h-hey!\nWait a sec--
Think you\ncould do a guy\na favor?
Sure,\nif we can be\nof any help.
Shh!\nWhat're you--
Let's hear\nhim out.
Sometimes all\npeople need is a\ngood listener.
We might\neven be able\nto solve his\nproblem.
If not,\ndon't worry.\nI promise I'll\nsay no.
You sap...
Look at\nthe bigger\npicture!
My band's\nsupposed to\nplay here in a\nfew hours,
but the\ntech's been\ngone all day.
Could you\ngo look for\nhim?
I gotta\nstay here and\nhold down the\nfort.
Man, where\nthe hell'd that\nslacker go?
So this tech's\npart of the\nconcert crew?
That's right.
He's in a\nblack tee.\nGot a lanyard\n'round his neck.
Without him,\nwe're screwed.
Why can't\nyou go find\nhim?
'Cause I got\na concert.
I can't go\nwandering off.
The name's 777\n(\x22Triple Seven\x22).
777...
777...
No way!
Like 777,\n\x22Def Märch\x22\nvocalist and rising\nsuperstar 777!?
Oh, you've\nheard of us?\nRock on.
We're still\ntotally indie.
But one day,\nwe're gonna start\na rock revolution,\njust wait an--
Nngh...
CAWFF!
Whoa, are\nyou all right?
Yeah,\nmy throat's\njust sore.
I had to shout\na lot during\nload-in.
It's hard to\nget anything\nset up without\nthe tech.
Oh, you\npoor thing...
No tech,\nno show,\nhuh?
So if we find\nthe guy...
You can\nrehearse if we\nfind your man?
Of course!\nIt's that, or call\noff the show.
So how\n'bout it?
Will you see\nif you can\nfind him?
We want to\nhelp, but...
We don't\nreally have time...\ndo we?
......
Sure,\nwe'll do it.
What?\nWe will!?
Yup.
Thanks, man!\nYou rock!
If you\nsee him,
tell him to\nhaul it back\nto A-East.
I'll be\nhere waiting.
OK.
Hee hee!
Ugh, stop\nlaughing.
Sorry, I've\njust never seen\nyou act so...\nnice.
...She still\ndoesn't get it.
If the tech\ncomes back, he\ncan turn on the\nlights.
Oh... Duh!\nNeku, that's\nbrilliant!
Plus, that\n777 guy?\nHe's a--
Now we can\nhelp 777\nAND finish the\nmission!
Sigh...
Sorry,\nbut we've got\nstuff to do.
It's cool.\nI'm sure you're\nbusy.
Just, if you\nsee him?
Tell him to\nhaul it back\nto A-East.
All right.\nWe will.
Thanks!
...Is that her\nidea of saying\nno?
Oh!\nThen you'll\nlook for him?
Hey, look!\nIt's Beat and\nRhyme.
Let's go\nsay hi!
......
Why?\nWe're not at\na party.
What a\npain in the\nrrgh...
Beat! Rhyme!
Heh.\nTalk about crap\nfor luck, yo.
Here comes\nPhones.
Gathered any\nintel for the\nmission?
No,\nnot at all.
But I know we'll\nget through it!
We just have\nto take out the\nmaster of A-East,\nright?
But then\nwhat's this\n[#FF0000]meme[#000000] for?
\x22Meme\x22?
What's a\n\x22meme\x22?
......
I think Shiki\ncould use our\nhelp.
We can tell\nher, right?
Well...aight.\nBut only 'cause\nit's Shiki.
So what's\na \x22meme\x22?
Memes are\nwords or ideas\nrelated to the\nmissions.
Whenever\nwe see or\nhear one,
it gets\nsent to our\nphones.
My phone\nhas the word\n[#FF0000]blackout[#000000].
Blackout?
Huh?\nI just got\nmail...
You're right.\nIt showed up on\nmy phone.
But what do\nmemes do?
They're for\n[#FF0000]imprinting[#000000].
What's your\ntake on today's\nmission?
You mean,\n\x22defeat the master\nof A-East\x22?
We were\nthere.
It's pitch\nblack.\nYou can't see\na thing.
Pitch black?\nHmm...
That might\nexplain the\nmeme...
So memes are\nfor imprinting.
Meaning...\nwhat?
Oh.\nImprinting's one\nof the Player\nPin's powers.
You can use it\nto send words\ninto other\npeople's heads.
This pin\ncan do that?
Oh yeah!
When you\nimprint--
Yo, forget it,\nRhyme.\nDon't bother.
Phones\ndon't trust us\nanyway.
Beat,\ndon't be like\nthat.
A problem\nshared is a\nproblem halved,\nright?
If we don't\nhelp each\nother out,
we'll all...\nWe might...
Ahh!\nNo, no!
There's nothing\nto worry about.
C'mon, Rhyme.\nLe's bounce.
Hmm...\nBeat's still\nmad...
I wish we\ncould patch\nthings up.
Why?\nJust leave\nhim alone.
Quit worrying\nabout everybody\nelse.
Well, at\nleast we know\nhow to [#FF0000]imprint\nmemes[#000000] now.
That was\nnice of Rhyme\nto tell us.
But what's\nthe point?
Well,\numm...
Ahh...\nWhat should\nI do?
Considering the\ncircumstances...
But...no...\nthat won't do.
What's tearing\nthat guy up?
It looks like\nhe can't make\nup his mind.
Hey!\nNeku, why don't\nwe try [#FF0000]imprinting[#000000]\non him?
Then we'll\nknow what it\ndoes.
OK...
Why not?\nLet's give it\na shot.
Erase XXX Noise\nto proceed.
Another\nwall.
No big deal.\nWe know how to\nhandle it now.
Hey!\nWhy don't we\ntry that pin?
Oh, the one\nMr. Hanekoma\ngave us?
OK, Phones!\nIn honor of your\ngrowth as a\nhuman being,
and a\nfriendship saved\nfrom the rocks,
I'm gonna give\nyou a little advice,\nand a little gift.
Make sure\nyou remember\nit all.
OK, but...
First, could\nYOU remember\nmy name?
Um,\nMr. Hanekoma,
It's Neku.\nNot \x22Phones.\x22
Oh, right!\nSorry, Neku.\nMy bad.
I got it now.
I wonder.
So let's start\nwith some\nQ & A.
You got\nquestions?\nI got answers.
To win the\n\x22Reapers' Game\x22...
you must\ncomplete seven\nmissions, one\neach day.
So...is it\ntrue that if\nwe don't,
we'll be\nerased?
Well, only\nif you all fail,\nto be precise.
Huh?
You two\naren't the only\nPlayers.
If any one\nPlayer completes\nthe mission, you\nall do.
Then we don't\nhave to play.
Ah, but if you\nall think like that\nand ignore the\nmissions--
Then we\nall wind up\nerased.
Furthermore,\nthe Reapers grade\nthe Players.
Grade us?
Naturally,\nyou get points\nfor finishing a\nmission.
But...\nwhat are the\ngrades for?
On the\nseventh day,\nyou'll know.
Just clear the\nmissions.
You'll be\nglad you did.
What are\nthe Reapers?
Their main jobs\nare running the\nGame, and testing\nthe Players.
So like that sister\nwho gave you\ntrouble before,
they'll get in the\nPlayers' way from\ntime to time.
She was such\na creep...
So they're\nlike some kind\nof group?
Yes!\nVery sharp,\nPhones.
......
You've seen\nthe guys in red,\nby the walls?\nThey're Reapers,\ntoo.
I knew it.
Whoa,\nreally?
But the\nguys by the\nwalls never\nattacked us.
Not all Reapers\nare cut from the\nsame cloth.
Some are\nHarriers;\nothers are just\nSupport.
The wall\nReapers are\nSupport.
They won't\nattack you.
All they do is\nissue conditions\nto pass the walls.
So they\ndon't fight.
The Harriers,\non the other hand,\nhunt Players for\na living.
It's not just\ntheir job, either.
If they don't\ndispatch Noise,\nerase Players, and\nscore points...
THEY get\nerased.
So we're\ntheir lunch.
Everybody's\ngotta eat,\nkiddo...
Mr. Hanekoma...\nWho are you?
What, me?\nPfft...
......
All right.\nI'll tell you\na little.
The name's\nSanae Hanekoma.\nBorn March 3,\nblood type A.
I'm a Pisces,\nand one hip café\nbarista, mista.
I didn't ask\nfor your\npersonal ad.
I'm a big gambler.\nMy favorite word:\n\x22windfall.\x22
\x22Natto\x22 gets\nmy tummy\nrumbling.
Like I said--
As for my\nphysical\ndimensions--
Stop. Please.
So you\nrun a café?
I thought\nyou said you\nwere a\nguardian.
The café's\nlike a hobby.
Totally hip,\nright?
Yeah! I think\nit's cool.
Uhh...\nwhat?
Drop by my\nplace if you get\nthe chance.
I'll give you\nthe best\ncuppa joe you\never had--
in exchange\nfor cash money,\nof course.
What kind of\ninvite is that!?
This...IS\nShibuya, right?
You bet.\nBut not your\nShibuya.
It's an alternate\nShibuya we call\nthe \x22UG.\x22
\x22UG\x22?
As in\n\x22Underground.\x22
The UG is one\nbig chessboard for\nthe Reapers' Game.
You expect\nus to believe\nthat?
The Shibuya\nyou came from is\ncalled the RG.\nThe \x22Realground.\x22
So we're in\nanother world?
No...
The RG and UG\nexist in the same\nspace.
What you\nsee is the RG--\nthe real deal.
......
The UG is\nrun by the\nComposer.
Who's that?
Shibuya's\nsupervisor.
Shibuya has\na supervisor?
Right.
I can't say\nanything more on\nthat subject.
It's classified,\nyou dig?
Now, for\nthat gift I\npromised...
In honor\nof you two\nmaking up!
What is\nthis pin?
It's blank.
What's its\npsych?
This one's a\nlittle different.\nIt takes two\npeople to use.
It only works\nagainst the Noise,\nwhen you two are\nin complete sync.
The more\nyou get in sync,\nthe more you Fuse\nyour energy,
the stronger the\npsych this puppy\nwill unleash.
You've got\ntalent, Phones.
You can use\na much wider\nrange of psychs\nthan the others.
Learn to\ncooperate, and\nyou might be able\nto use this one,\ntoo.
Yeah!\nYou're great\nat psychs.
Way better\nthan me.
You think?
There, see?\nYou take good\ncare of that.
Let's try and\nget it to work,\nNeku!
......
But...I can't\nuse it by myself.
I'm supposed\nto sync up with\nHER?
Not happening.
What good's\na powerful pin if\nI can't use it?
Just to be\nclear...
You need\nmore than talent\nto use that.
It takes\nsomebody with\n[#FF0000]style[#000000]...
if you catch\nmy drift.
I'll use it.
And please...
My name is Neku.\nNot \x22Phones.\x22
Oh, right!
Sorry\n'bout that.
I got it now,\nPhones!
......
He was quite a\ncharacter, huh?
And really bad\nwith names.
What a nice\nguy, giving us\nthat pin.
And fun\nto talk to.
I'll give\nyou that.
Something\nabout him just...\npulls you in.
Not sure\nwhy, but...
I kind of want\nto talk to him\nsome more.
Neku!\nLet's try\nthe pin!
......
So I have\nto sync up\nwith her?
Pfft, right.
What's\nwrong?
Oh, I know.
You forgot\nhow it works,\nright?
You're\nhopeless.
......
Let's\nsee...
First, we\nhave to fight\nin sync.
And that's\nwhere this all\ngoes to hell.
Then, once\nwe've got a\ngroove going,
this pin\nwill activate,
and you\ncan use it!
Great\nexplanation.
Ready to\ngive it a shot?
OK!
Here goes\nnothing!
......
Come on.
What?\nYou're not going\nto fight?
I'm not\nready.
All right.
No rush.
So, did you get\nthe hang of it?
Or do you\nwant to practice\nsome more?
If we work\ntogether...
we should\nget a ton of\nuse out of this!
......
Man, screw\nthe concert.
Can't they\nhire another\ntech?
Psst!\nNeku, did you\nhear that?
Yup.\nLooks like we\nfound our man.
Guess he's\non strike.
He picked\nthe right noodle\nbar to hide in.
Empty in the\nmiddle of lunch\nhour?
I'm tellin' ya,\nI've got stage\npresence!
I'm not the\nbehind-the-scenes\ntype, OK?
Well, just\nremember, son.\nThe future is\na clean slate,\nand you're the\nchalk!
Now have\na hot bowl of\nramen and\ncheer...
...up?\nHey, where'd\nhe go?
Sigh...\nI can't win.
Young people\njust won't eat\nold-fashioned\nnoodles...
Neku!\nThe tech just\ntook off!
What?\nDammit!
I don't\ncare if I have to\nDRAG him back\nto A-East!
Whew...\nI just can't deal\nanymore.
Wish I could\ncurl up and\nforget all this.
Wow.\nTalk about\nyour negative\nvibes.
He'll never\ncome back with\nus now.
Yes, he will.\nHe has to.
He seems\nso down.
I wonder\nwhat's on his\nmind...
Hey!\nHe's surrounded\nby Noise!
You're\nright!
It's like he's\npossessed!
Man, now\nI feel all out\nof whack.
It just\ngets worse\nand worse.
It's no good.\nI can't read his\nthoughts with all\nthe Noise.
We should\nerase the Noise\naround him.
Then we\nshould be able\nto scan him!
Huh?\nWhat am I\ndoing here?
Oh, crap!\nLook at the\ntime!
I gotta\nget back to\nA-East!
Good.\nNow he'll head\nback.
And once\nhe does, we'll\nhave power.
Pretty weird,\nthough, the way\nhe snapped right\nout of it.
Yeah...
You think the\nNoise are out to\nhijack people's\nminds?
But then\nwhat about\nlast time?
Remember?\nThey erased\nthe people they\nattacked.
Maybe they're\nlike the Reapers--\nnot all cut from\nthe same cloth.
Or maybe--
Well, either\nway, they're not\ngood for you!
If we see\nanyone else\npossessed,
let's get\nrid of the Noise\nfor them.
OK,\nCaptain Sappy.\nRoger that.
C'mon,\nlet's drop by\nA-East.
The tech\nshould be back\nby now.
The hell\nyou been?\nGo get us ready\nfor rehearsal!
I'm sorry,\n777...
But...the\nstage lighting's\nbusted.
It's what?\nHow're we gonna\nrehearse--
no, how're\nwe gonna PLAY\nTHE SHOW!?
I got\na repairman\nworking on it.
That's why\nI was out--\nto pick up a\npart he needs.
Great!\nThen we're\nready to rock.
Huh?
You got the\npart, right?
Umm...\nDefine \x22got\x22...
You nimrod!\nGo get the part.\nMove it!
Right away!
Uh-oh...\nMore trouble?
Hey!
Domo arigato\nfor findin' the\ntech!
You're\nwelcome, but...\nSomething\nwrong?
Yeah, sounds\nlike our lighting's\non the fritz.
The guy\njust went hunting\nfor a replacement\npart.
Nngh...\nI've been shouting\nall day long.
My throat's\nkilling me.
Guess we're\ngonna be in the\ndark a while\nlonger.
Think the\ntech's got it\ncovered?
...Maybe we\nshould check\non him.
Man...\nWhat do I do?
What was that\npart I need a\nreplacement for?
I can't go\nback and ask\nnow...
Hey, isn't that\nthe tech?
Yup.\nFull of fail,\nas usual.
Neku!
I know. I'll try\nimprinting.
I have\nto hurry!
And away\nhe goes.
Maybe he'll\nbuy the part\nnow.
Or maybe\nhe won't...
We'd better\nfollow him.
Quit playing\naround!
Wait, wait--
I got the\npart!
Damn right you do!\nNow fix the lights!
Eep!
That should\ndo it!
Finally\nwe can see\ninside.
Yeah.\nC'mon!
Quit playing\naround!
Wait, wait--
I got the\npart!
Damn right you do!\nNow fix the lights!
I-I-I will!\nBut first--
What now?
I thought\nyou could use\nthese before\nthe show.
Cough\ndrops?
I've really been\nlooking forward\nto your concert!
......
...Go on,\nget outta here.
Right!
Hey!
Y-yeah?
Let's make\nrock history,\nman.
Y-you\nknow it!
Good thing\nhe picked those\nup, huh?
And now\nwe have light!
Finally\nwe can see\ninside.
Thanks for\neverything.
Here.\nFor you.
It's Def Märch\nband swag.
One day\nit'll be worth\nmillions!
Ooh!\nThanks!
I better\nsee you at\nthe show.
Later!
All right!\nLet's finish\nthis mission.
Right!
Look!\nHe just went\ninside.
Let's move.
Uh-oh...\nSome kind of\ntrouble?
Umm...\nIs something\nwrong?
Yeah, you\ncould say\nthat.
Our concert's\nabout to start,\nand the stage lights\nare on the fritz...
Our tech\nwent out to buy\na replacement\npart...
but what if\nhe doesn't make\nit back in time?
Unngh...\nI've been shouting\nall day long.
My throat's\nkilling me.
Guess we're\ngonna be in the\ndark a while.
Think the\ntech's got it\ncovered?
...Maybe we\nshould check\non him.
What's the\nstory?
This should\njust about\ndo it...
All fixed?
Yup!\nTry flipping\nthe breaker.
OK!\nHere goes!
Hmm?
No good...\nThe power\nblew again.
What!?\nWhy?
I thought\nyou fixed it!
What's wrong\nnow?
I dunno...
Maybe the\nfuse wasn't the\nproblem.
Wait!\nSomething's in\nhere!
Huh!?
It's coming!\nGet ready!
Geez!\nTalk about a\nheart attack!
But...\nthat was the\nmaster, right?
Nope!\nClock's still\nticking!
You're kidding!\nThen...where's\nthe master!?
No!\nWe're out\nof time!
Don't drop\nthe ball now,\nyo!
Here's your\n\x22master\x22!
Beat!\nRhyme!
Yo, looks like\nwe made it.
Yup!\nThe timer's\ngone now.
Mission\ncomplete.
But...I'm so\nconfused...
Huh?\nIt's fixed!
You sure?
Uh-huh.\nThe lights should\nwork now.
OK, I'm\ngonna go tell\nthe others!
Looks like\nthey're in\nbusiness.
This place\nis gonna fill\nright up.
We should\nstep outside\nfor now.
Oh, so taking\nout the giant bat\nwasn't enough!
Whoops.
Good thing\nyou two came\nalong.
We owe you!
Man...\nYou two shoulda\ngathered more\ninfo, yo.
I'm talkin' to\nyou, Phones!
Hee hee...
What,\nRhyme?
Stop trying\nto act tough,\nBeat.
We didn't\nhave all the\ninfo, either!
You wouldn't\nhave found the\nlittle golden bat\nif it wasn't for\nthem.
Know why?
Let me guess.\nWe had to beat\nthe big golden\nbat first.
Bwaaah!
Yeah...\nYou act like\nyou got the\nanswers now,
but you\nwas freakin'\nout before!
So were\nyou, Beat.
Bwaaah!\nWhose side\nyou on, yo?
Ha ha ha!
Hee hee.
Least I got\nthe job done,\naight?
...Heh.
Hey, I heard\nthat, yo!
Who said\nYOU could\nlaugh at me?
Look.\nThe concert's\nstarting.
Wait...
'Sup now?
How come\nwe were able to\ntalk to him?
You know,\n777.
'Cause he's\na Reaper.
WHAT!?
Mr. Hanekoma\nexplained all\nthis.
Did you\nforget?
Now\nlisten up.
This Shibuya\nain't your\nShibuya.
It's the\nComposer's\nShibuya,
which the\nReapers use to\nrun the Game.
No matter\nwhat happens,\npeople won't see\nyou, won't hear\nyou--
and they\ndefinitely won't\nhelp you.
Your partner's\nthe only one\nwho can keep\nyou alive.
So we're\nbasically\ninvisible?
Only those\ninvolved in the\nGame can see\nyou.
So...the Players,\nthe Reapers, and...\nyou?
Right.
Why am I\neven in this\nstupid Game?
All Players\ncome from the\nRG to the UG\nfor a common\nreason.
And each\nmust forfeit the\none thing they\nvalue most as an\nentry fee.
What we\nvalue most?
Do we get\nit back?
If you win.
...And if\nwe don't?
You lose your\nentry fee forever.\nAnd--
well, your\nright to exist.
That's\nright...
He mentioned\nonly Reapers and\nother Players can\nsee us.
So we're\non our own.
......
You think...
You think\nwe'll make it?
We'll make it.
No matter\nwhat!
Heh.\nThink you\ncan deliver,\nPhones?
Hey,\nyou know...
we really\ndo make a\ngood team.
Starting\ntomorrow, what\ndo you say we\nwork together?
We only\nsurvived today\nbecause of\nteamwork.
I agree!
And what\ndoesn't kill us\nonly makes us\nstronger.
If Rhyme's\ndown with it,\nthen so am I.
No objections,\nNeku?
How can I\nobject?
I still don't\nknow anything\nabout the UG...
Or about myself...\nor the Reapers...
All I do\nknow
is that these\nguys aren't my\nenemies.
Hey, Neku.
Remember what\nMr. Hanekoma\nsaid.
\x22Trust your\npartner.\x22
I remember.\nAnd now I\nsee why.
What else\ncan I trust?
Especially in\na backwards\nShibuya like\nthis.
Just don't\ndrag me down.
Yay!\nThat settles it.
Here's to\nteamwork!
Today six\nPlayers were\nerased, sir.
Six?\nMy, my...
That puts us\nat the 50%\nerased mark,
one full day\nearlier than\nexpected.
Higashizawa's\ndoing nicely,\nthen.
Yes, sir.
That concludes\ntoday's report.
We have our\nregular meeting\ntomorrow.
Same time as\nalways, sir.
Right.\nGood work.
Heh...
Is something\namiss, sir?
No, no...\nIt's just--
I have a\nfeeling that\ntomorrow's\nGame
will be very\nentertaining.
Tick, tock,\nMinamimoto.\nYou're 9 minutes and\n42 seconds late.
Tick, tock\nyourself,\nKonishi.
Why are we\neven here?
I can think of\na decillion better\nways to spend\nour time...
than by having\nMEETINGS.\nRight, Megs?
You will\naddress him as\n\x22Mr. Kitaniji.\x22
It's fine.
Are we\nall here?
Hey, Megs--
Who's the\nbulldozer?
Meet\nHigashizawa--\nthis session's\nGame Master.
He'll be\nhandling affairs\nin my stead.
You do\nme a great\nhonor, sir.
Watch! I will turn\nthis week's fracas\ninto a fricassee!
You planning\nto erase them,\nor EAT them?
Yes,\ncrack your\njokes.
But his skill\nis proven.
That's right.\nHigashizawa\nexcels--
in tactics,\nintel, willpower,\ndecisiveness,\nperformance,
his Player\nerasure\nrate...
He surpasses\nour expectations\non every count.
A man of\nsound judgment\nlike Mr. Kitaniji\nwould not choose\nhim otherwise.
And he knows\nhow to [#FF0000]cooperate[#000000],\nunlike some--
Cooperation\nis garbage.
Anyway, I'm out.\nThis is subtracting\nfrom my arts and\ncrafts time.
Wait just a--\nMr. Kitaniji hasn't\nspoken yet!
Let him do\nwhat he wants.
Yes, sir...
Now, then...\nHigashizawa.\nYou're doing\nvery well.
Thank you, sir!\nOver half the Players\nhave been erased.
The plates have\nbeen licked...
Dessert is\nimminent.
Excellent.\nI look forward\nto it.
I spoke to\nthe Composer\nabout your\npromotion.
We are in\nagreement.
Thank you\nvery much,\nsir.
I feel you\nare ready...
but, I have\none condition.
What, sir?\nName it.
I expect you,\nas my proxy\nin the Game,
to leave\nno Player\nunerased.
Fear not,\nsir.
The proof is\nin the pudding.
The pudding...\nof their doom.
Yawwwn...\nWhere am I\nnow?
Hey, you\nawake?
What are\nyou doing?
Just people-\nwatching.
I mean, look\nat them all...
Shibuya's\nso diverse.
And everybody's\ngot their own story.
Shibuya\nsucks.
Who needs a\ntown with this\nmany people?
All they do\nis get in the way\nand screech at\neach other.
They're\nthe REAL\nNoise.
Wish I\nhad a giant\nMute button.
But yo, you\never try scanning\n'em all?
It's like havin'\nthe radio on every\nchannel at once.
Yeah...\nLike everybody's\nvalues
are all\ntrying to come in\nthe loudest.
No other\ntown compares.
Shibuya's a\nbattlefield.
Yeah...
It is kinda\nlike that.
A clash\nof creeds.
But man...\nAll these\npeople,
and they\ncan't even see\nus, yo.
Yeah...\nMakes you sad,\nhuh?
Sad!?
I'm\nthankful.
Nobody\nsees me.
Nobody\nbothers me.
And nobody\nexpects anything\nof me.
This is like\na dream.
Once I survive\nthe seven days,
does the\ndream end?
Go back\nto the old\nShibuya?
......
Mission\ntime, yo!
Nothing the\nfour of us\ncan't handle!
Yeah!
\x22Reach\nTowa Records.
\x22No time limit.\nFail, and face erasure.\n--The Reapers\x22
Huh?\nNo time limit?
But...\nthat's waaay\nsimple!
Towa Records\nis a ten-minute\nwalk.
Why wouldn't\nthey set a time\nlimit?
So we're\njust walkin' a\ncouple blocks?
Man. I was\npumped for a\nbrawl, yo!
Guess\nwe don't need\nto team up.
......
But this is\ntoo weird.
Hundred yen\nsays they've got\nsomething else up\ntheir sleeves.
Yo, hold up!\nI jus' got a\ngreat idea!
So what's your\ngreat idea?
For today's\nmission...
How 'bout\nyou two race\nus two,
and we see\nwho gets to\nTowa Records\nfirst?
Whaaat?
C'mon,\nRhyme, le's\nbook it!
Wha...huh!?\nWait, Beat!
Heh heh...\nBeat's got a\nlot of energy,\nhuh?
Yeah.\nHe keeps me\non the ball.
Sometimes he\ncan get a little\ncrazy, though.
Beat's the\none who asked\nme to be his\npartner.
Wow,\nso you--
Omigosh...
Rhyme, is\nthat what I\nthink it is?
Huh?\nWhat?
That pendant!\nWhere did you\nfind one?
Oh, this?\nYeah, I heard\nthey sold out\nquick.
How'd\nyou know\nabout it?
I saw it in a\nmagazine.
I looove\nfollowing the\nlatest clothes and\naccessories.
Lucky...\nI wanted one\nsooo bad.
I'm sorry I can't\ngive you mine.
But it was\na present from\nmy brother.
You've got\na brother?
Yeah.\nOlder.
He's really\nnice.
Hope he's\nOK...
Oh, I'm sure\nhe's doing great.\nAnd you'll see\nhim soon!
Yeah...\nI hope so.
So you're\ninto fashion?
Totally!\nI want to be\na designer.
I love making\nclothes.
But right\nnow it's just\na hobby.
I still think\nit's pretty\ncool.
It must be\nnice to have\na dream--
to be head\nover heels about\nsomething.
I don't know\nwhat it's like.
Not really.
Why not?
You don't\nhave any\ndreams?
No...
But when\nI look at Beat\nI think:
keep moving\nforward.
Because\nsomeday my\ndream will\nfind me.
Yeah.
Beat's really\ngood at\nskateboarding.
He says\nhis dream is to\nbe the world's\ngreatest skater.
If he can\ndo it, then\nso can I.
Right, Shik--
YO, RHYME!
Whatchu doin'?\nMove it!
We don't\nwant Phones\nto win!
Just a\nminute, Beat!\nPatience is a\nvirtue!
Well, I'd\nbetter go.
See you at\nTowa Records!
Whoa!\nBeat's just a\nspeck now.
Rhyme must\nhave a rough time\nkeeping up.
I'll say.
So, um, shouldn't\nwe hurry?
I never\nagreed to\nrace.
If he wants\nto run, good\nfor him.
Then we can\nslow down for\na bit?
Sure,\nwhy not?
There's no time\nlimit, and those\ntwo have got a\nhead start.
So...we can\ntake a little\nside trip?
Where are\nyou going with\nthis?
Mind if\nwe stop at\nTen-Four?
...I guess not.
Really?\nThanks!
...Yooo!\nWhere you goin'!?
What's up?
Like I said,\nI got a great\nidea!
Yeah?
Like,\nwhat gives,\nKariya!?
Who made\ntoday's mission for\nages 3 and up!?
Aight, easy, girl.\nDeep breaths.
Stress is\nbad for your\ncomplexion.
Well, excuse me!\nEasy missions\nmake me furious!
Ugh.\nI need to go\ndestroy some\nPlayers--
Whoa, let's\nthink about\nthis.
Put yourself\nin the Players'\nshoes.
You've made it to\nDay 4, the mission's\na breeze...
What are\nyou gonna\nthink?
Hmph...\nPoint taken.
Guess the\nboss thought\nit through.
'Sides...\nDays off are like\nlove letters from\nthe higher-ups.
We can't\ngo full blast\nall week.
We'd never\nmake it.
Please.\nSince when does\nyour dial even GO\nto full blast?
Details.
Anyway,\nwe've got our own\norders straight from\nthe boss.
All right...\nYou win.
Let's see\nhow this plays\nout.
Ugh...\nIt's a zoo\nin here.
Are they\nhaving a sale\nor what?
No, silly.\nTen-Four's always\nlike this.
Ah! Omigosh!\nThat outfit!
Is that the\nnew line?
You don't\nknow how badly\nme and Eri--
......
Sorry...\nMe and my\nfriend used to\ncome here.
...Friend?
The girl on\nher phone?
IT'S\nHEEEEEEM!
Noise!?
Hey...\nOver there!
The Prince\nlooks sooo\nhot!
I gotta snap\na photo with\nmy phone!
Oh.\nNot Noise...\nJust noisy.
Who is\nthat guy?
Eiji Oji.\nThe Prince\nof Ennui?
He's the\nlatest superstar.\nPeople love his\ndon't-give-a-damn\nattitude.
His blog,\n\x22F Everything,\x22\ngets 100,000\nhits a day!
\x22F Everything\x22?\nWhat kind of blog\nis that?
Hmm?\nYou, young\nman!
Huh?
What are\nyou doing in\nTen-Four
if you can't\neven coordinate\nan outfit?
Have you no\nsense of Shibuya's\n[#FF0000]trends[#000000]?
Who the...\nSigh.
Trends?
Yeah, you\nknow. Like what\nbrands are hot?
Ah, the\nblessed voice\nof wisdom.
At least\none of you\nknows how\nto dress.
I have to!\nShibuya is every\ngirl's war zone.
Good thing\nI'm not a\ngirl...
You should\nknow a trendy\noutfit
can turn a\npigsty into the\n[#FF0000]loveliest of\ngardens[#000000].
But you, in\nthat outfit?
It's like wrapping\nthe rose of youth\ninto a [#FF0000]spicy\ntuna roll[#000000].
Arrogant\nsnob.
I am not\na...a spicy\ntuna roll!
He's right,\nNeku. As long as\nwe're here--
Oh, no.\nCount me out.
I don't care\nabout trends.
I wear\nwhat I want\nto wear.
Ugh, no,\nyou can't do\nthat!
They call\nit a fashion\nstatement for\na reason!
How you\ndress sends a\nclear message.
Then I wish\nI had more\nzippers...
so I could\ntell you to\nZIP IT.
Look, you've\ngot potential.
You could\nbe sooo much\ncooler.
And I KNOW\nfashion.
C'mon,\nit's so easy to\nbe trendy.
......
Well, I'm\nnot going to\nforce you.
But your\nclothes...
They're,\num...
......
Not, like,\nbad, but...
WHAT?
Ahh!\nNothing, nothing!\nJust forget I\nbrought it up.
Suddenly,\nI feel naked.
So what's\nso great about\ntrends?
Oh!\nChanged your\nmind?
'Course not.
I'm just\nasking.
Well,\nShibuya's kind\nof unique.
Trends here\nchange really\nquickly.
And they\nchange YOU,\nand the people\naround you.
So it's better\nfor you
if you can\nstay in control\nof them.
Better how?
Shibuya has [#FF0000]13 brands[#000000].\nTheir popularity\ndetermines where they\nfall on the [#FF0000]brand charts[#000000].
[#FF0000]Each area[#000000] has its own\nbrand chart which you\ncan view from the\nHome Menu.
The chart's hottest\nbrands earn an [#FF0000]Attack\nbonus[#000000] in combat!\nBut on the flip side...
I don't need\nhelp being cool.
I know\nwhat I'm doing,\nNeku.
I've been\nstudying fashion\nbit by bit,
so I can\nbe a designer\none day.
No kidding.
I've always\nliked to sew.
I started\nwith little things\nlike stuffed\nanimals.
So the one\nyou're always\ncarting around--\nyou made that?
Yup.\nThe clothes I've\ngot on, too.
Seriously!?
Wow.\nThey look like\nwhat you'd buy\nin a store.
Heh,\nthanks.
But the\nclothes, I just\nsewed them.
Eri did the\ndesign.
She's the\namazing one.
Eri?
Oh.\nThe girl from\nher phone.
I still have a\nlot to learn.
But one day...
So that\nstuffed animal is\nyour creation.
I...I made him\na long time ago,\nso he's not very\ngood.
Why do you\nstill have it?\nStuffed animals\nare for kids.
Shut up!\nThis is my\npsych!
How else am\nI gonna fight off\nthe Noise?
That...\nis your psych?
You mean...
you use\nthat piggy as\na weapon?
He's not\na pig!
He's a cat!\nMr. Mew the\ncat!
\x22Mr. Mew\x22?
How old\nis she?\nThree?
Look, I only\nknow how to use\ntele...whatever.
Telekinesis?\nOK, but why a\nstuffed animal?
Couldn't you\npick something\nmore powerful?
Like a knife,\nor a...a lead pipe\nor something?
I tried.\nBut Mr. Mew was\nthe only thing\nthat worked.
Besides,\nI'm not really\nmoving him.
He just\nsort of does\nhis own thing.
Umm...\nThat's not\ntelekinesis.
Hmm...\nI guess not.
The pig moves\non its own?
What if it's\npossessed--
waiting to\npork-chop us\nin the back of\nthe head?
I know he\nturned out awful,\nbut...
without him,\nI never would've\nstarted sewing\nfor real.
So, a fashion\ndesigner, huh?
Yup!\nI want to make\nclothes for a\nliving.
Nice clothes\nmake people\nhappy.
And that\nmakes me happy,\ntoo.
Hmph.
She's got\nher whole future\nplanned out.
Never woulda\nthought.
So that's\nwhy you're so\npicky about\nclothes.
Heh heh,\nI try.
But I\nstill have a\nways to go.
There's so\nmuch to learn.
Cool.
I didn't give\nher enough\ncredit.
She's got\na dream.
That's more\nthan I can\nsay.
Pay attention\nto the trends from\nnow on, Neku.
......
OK, let's\nhead to Towa\nRecords.
Beat and Rhyme\nare probably\nwaiting.
Hey, Neku...\nHold up.
What?
When I scan,\nsometimes I see\nthis weird green\nsymbol.
Wonder what\nit is.
Green\nsymbol?
......
Hey,\nyou're right.
Reminds me\nof a pig.
Hey!\nRemember?
The special\nNoise!
The ones\nMr. Hanekoma\nmentioned.
You mean the\n[#FF0000]Pig Noise[#000000]?
He said\nPig Noise always\ndrop pins.
Uh-huh.
So, like,\nshouldn't we go\nfight them?
Free stuff!
Big deal.
Plus the pins\nyou're wearing will\nget stronger from\nfighting.
It's a win-win\nsituation.
Right?
...Right.
Good, it's\nsettled.\nLet's take those\npiggies out!
Hmm...\nAnd the pig\nindicator on my\nphone is lit.
Your phone's [#FF0000]pig indicator[#000000]\n(in the upper-right corner\nof the screen) will light up\nwhen you enter an area\nwith [#FF0000]Pig Noise[#000000].
That's your cue to scan\nthe area and put the\nlittle porkers on ice!
Ahh, enough!
Just looking at\nyou makes me\ncringe!
What did\nI do!?
What's\ngotten into\nher?
It's coming\nloose.
Umm...
What,\nyour grip on\nreality?
Neku...\nThat button on\nyour shorts.
Oh, yeah.
What does\nit matt--
It matters!
I can't\nstand things\nlike that!
Who cares?\nIt's just a\nbutton.
Off.
What?
Your shorts.\nTake them off!\nI'll fix the\nbutton.
Are you high!?
I'm not\ntaking my pants\noff in front of\nyou--
in the middle\nof the street!
Oh, grow up.\nWhat, are you\ngoing commando?
You're invisible!\nNo one's\nwatching.
YOU'RE\nwatching!
Now!\nPants! Off!
Doooooon't!!!
There.\nAll done!
Whew,\nI feel much\nbetter.
Loose\nbuttons drive\nme nuts.
That was...\nfast...
You always\ncarry around\na needle and\nthread?
Of course.
They come\nin handy.
Plus I enjoy\nsewing.
If you need\nanything else\nmended,
just say\nthe word!
......
Will I have to\nstrip again?
I'd better\ntake care of\nmy clothes...
How's work\ngoing, Makoto?
Bad.
The boss\nwants me to\npromote some\nnew pins.
But how?
I don't\nknow anything\nabout pins.
Sounds\nrough.
Yeah.\nI've been trying\nto study up.
Like, people\nuse pins to play\nTin Pin Slammer,\nright?
So I'm thinking\nof hitting the slam-off\nat Molco next week.
To pick up\nthe lingo, you\nknow?
But tickets\nare completely\nsold out.
The Tin Pin\nslam-off,\nhuh...
If you\nhad a ticket,\nyou'd go?
Uh-huh.
Hmm...
Huh?\nIsn't that...
......
Oh, hey!\nThere's Beat\nand Rhyme.
The hell you\nbeen, yo?
This is\na race!
Ain't you\neven tryin'?
Nope.\nYou're on your\nown there.
Ain't you angry\nyou lost?
Don't you\nwanna WIN?
Don't YOU?\nWhy did you\nwait for us?
We...\nWe was just...
Hee hee...
Beat said\nwe should let\nyou catch up.
Bwaaah!
Yo, Rhyme,\ncan it!
Aww, Beat's\na big softy\nunderneath!
Shh...Shiki!\nNot you, too!
I...I just\nwanted to see\nPhones squirm,\ntha's all.
Now le's\nget this mission\nover with.
We got\nhere first,\nso we win.
Eat that,\nslowpokes.
Uh-huh.\nConsider it\neaten.
Heh heh!\nC'mon, Rhyme.\nLe's bounce!
W-wait,\nBeat!
You're going to\ntrip if you don't\nslow down!
She's so\nlucky, having her\nbest friend as a\npartner.
Guess you\nshould've teamed\nup with that friend\nin your picture.
Would've\nsaved me a\nlot of grief.
But...\nI couldn't...
We're...
......
Come on.\nWe should go.
Wh-wh-what\njust happened!?
Awww!\nThere goes my\nerase streak.
He was\nsupposed to be\nnumber 16.
Reapers?
Bingo!\nI'm Koki Kariya...
And this is\nUzuki Yashiro.
There.\nNow that we're\nall friends--
Hey!\nWhat did you do\nwith Rhyme?
Um...hello?\nYou just saw.
She's gone.\nErased.
Noise food.\nGame over.
Her soul's\njust another speck\nof Shibuya space\ndust.
No...
Rhyme's gone...\nfor good?
You...
You did\nthis!?
Yeah.\nBut, like,\nso what?
That's our\nJOB.
Boss said\nset a trap,\nso we did.
Your job?
Screw\nyour job!
Murderers!
You...
You erased\nRhyme!!!
Give her back, yo,\nor you'll pay!
Ooh,\nscary.
Go on, Skulls.\nBe the star of\nyour little soap\nopera.
But Skulls, Jr.\nisn't gone\nbecause of us.
What?
She's gone\nbecause of\nyou.
You failed to\nprotect your\npartner.
So face\nreality.
We hunt\nPlayers down.
You KNEW\nthat.
I-I didn't--
Well,\nSkulls, Jr.\nknew.
That's why\nshe protected\nyou.
Gave her life\nfor you.
Rhyme is\ngone...
because\nof me?
Awww...\nBoo hoo.
But don't\nworry. You won't\nsuffer for long,\nhee hee!
Noise!?
You punks\ncan make\nNoise?
Bingo!\nAll you need is\nsome Soul and a\npin to bind it to.
We'd looove\nto take you on\nourselves,
but attacking\nPlayers directly\nis against the\nrules.
So we use\nNoise instead.
So!\nOur work here\nis done...
Time to\ncall it a day.
Buh-bye.\nNice knowing\nyou.
Oh, yeah.\nOne last thing,\nSkulls.
You want\npayback?\nThen man up,\nhuh?
HEY!!!
Get back here,\nyou son of a...
Dontchu\nrun from me!
Dontchu\nrun, yo...
Don't...
Hey, we\ngotta get rid of\nthis Noise.
Yeah.\nOtherwise...
Start with\nthe smaller\nNoise!
There.\nThat leaves\njust the big\none.
Right!
Dontchu\ntouch it, yo.
Huh?
This one's\nmine.
This bastard\ntook Rhyme\nfrom me.
Get in my way\nand I'll knock you\nright outta here!
Don't be\nstupid!
Wh-who's\nthere?
You're down\na partner.
How you\nthink you're\ngonna take on\nthe Noise?
Like I care!\nButt out, yo!
I gotta avenge\nRhyme!
You mean waste\nher sacrifice!
You're powerless.\nAccept it!
Rrgh...
Rhyme left you\na precious gift.\nYour life!
Gift?
A Player can\nonly live for seven\nminutes after their\npartner is erased.
Which leaves\nyou with less\nthan three.
Rrgh...
Think about\nwhy she\nsaved you.
My life's\nover anyway.
You jus'\nsaid so.
There's a\nway to keep\nyou alive.
But you have\nto come with me.\nNow!
Why should I\nlive when she\ncan't, yo?
Beat, go with him.\nRhyme would want\nit that way.
But--
We'll handle\nthis.
She was our\nfriend, too.
Ahhhhhh...
Listen.\nYou may be\nalone.
But there's\nstill a role that\nonly you can\nplay.
I'll tell you\nwhat that is,\nbut you have\nto live!
Grrraaaaaah!!!
...Fine.
But you\nbetter kill that\nbastard dead.\nAvenge Rhyme!
Well...\nWe're alone\nagain.
Think Beat'll\nbe OK?
Mr. Hanekoma's\nwith him.\nHe's fine.
But...he only\nhad three minutes\nto live.
So what were\nwe supposed\nto do?
I don't know...
Why couldn't\nwe save Rhyme?
Because we\ncouldn't.\nThat's how it was\nmeant to be.
How can you\njust write her off\nlike that!?
Don't you care?\nAren't you SAD!?
We could\nhave done\nsomething!
Yeah?\nLike what?
Dammit...\nI feel like\ncrap.
This is\njust like that\ntime...
That time?
What time?
......
I can't\nremember.
...You see?
See why\nteaming up is\na dumb idea?
How dare you!
You think\nNOT teaming up\nwould have\nsaved her?
How can\nyou be so\nCOLD?
Beat and\nRhyme were\nour friends!
What happened\nto her...
We're all\nresponsible!
It was our\nfault, too...
Then who\nneeds 'em.
Huh?
Who needs\nfriends!
They just\nlaugh and talk\nlike idiots and\npretend to agree\nwith you--
so you end up\ncaring about them...\nexposing yourself...\ngetting HURT...
Screw it!
We're better\noff without\nthem!
You want people\ngetting in your way?\nDragging you down?
I don't!
And I never\nsaid we were\nfriends.\nYou did!
Neku!
I am your friend.\nSo is Rhyme--
Back off!\nNo one's my\nfriend.
Least of\nall you.
I just stay\nwith you to\nsurvive.
Neku...\nHow c-could\nyou...
You didn't\nfeel anything\nwhen Rhyme\nwas erased?
Not even a\nlittle sad?
That's\ninhuman...
You're inhuman,\nNeku.
No better\nthan those\nReapers!
Unnh...\nWhere am I?
Hey.\nYou awake?
......
The mission's\nnot here yet.
Looks like\nwe start at\nTipsy Tose Hall\ntoday.
So, um...
sorry about\nyesterday.
I crossed\nthe line with\nwhat I said.
That I was\nno better than\na Reaper...
Rhyme...
......
Well.\nRight now...
we need\nto focus on\nthe mission.
Yeah.\nYou're right.
For Beat.
It's here!\nThe mission!
\x22Free Spain Hill\nfrom the Noise.
\x22You have\n200 minutes. Fail,\nand face erasure.\n--The Reapers\x22
Free it?\nThen we have\nto erase some\nNoise.
Spain Hill's\nright over\nthere.
Then let's\nget going.
So we just\nhave to clear\nthe Noise out of\nhere, right?
Let's get\nstarted.
Hey...Mina?\nWhere were you\nyesterday?
Yesterday?
Ahh...umm...
Ten-Four!\nYeah...
The Prince\nwas there for a\nspecial event.
You should've\nseen how hot he\nlooked!
Oh...
So you weren't\nover by, say...\nShibu Department\nStore?
Huh?
No! No...\nI don't think so.\nWhy?
Nothing.\nNever mind.
Huff...huff...
This isn't\nworking...
We're not\neven making\na dent.
Why do more\nNoise keep\nshowing up?
You think\nsomething is\ndrawing them\nhere?
If so,\nwe'll have to\nstrike at the\nsource.
...Wherever\nthat is.
C'mon, Ai.\nWhat's wrong?
Nothing...
Neku.\nLook!
Those two\ngirls that just left\nthe restaurant...
Ai, are you\nmad at me?
Don't be\nridiculous.
You...\nyou sure?
Yes! OK?
Whoa!\nLook at all\nthe Noise!
What's up with\nthose two?
Looks like\nthey're having\nan argument--
and that's\ndrawing all\nthe Noise.
I think we\nfound our\nsource.
OK. Let's try\ngetting rid of the\nNoise around\nthem!
That takes\ncare of those\nNoise.
No... Look!\nHere come\nsome more!
Crap.\nThis will never\nwork.
Those two\nkeep drawing\nmore in.
What's\ntheir story,\nI wonder?
Hey, Ai,\nare you free\naround this time\nnext week?
......
Probably.\nWhy?
N-nothing...\nForget it.
......
Whoa,\nfeel all that\nnegativity?
What if that's\nattracting\nthe Noise?
Huh?
Remember\nlast time?
The Noise\nhijacked the\ntech
because he\nwas jealous.
Hey, you're\nright...
But these\ntwo don't look\npossessed.
They're just...\ncalling out to\nthe Noise.
Wait...
Of course!
If we help\nthem patch\nthings up--
The Noise will\nstop coming!
Brilliant!\nLet's try it!
First we\nhave to figure\nout what's\nwrong...
YEAH!!!\nI can't wait\nto play in the\nslam-off!
C'mon, Yammer!\nYou sign up, too!
The grand\nprize is a\nHero Pin!?
Dude!\nThose are\nsooo rare!
Slam-off?\nWhat's that?
Check the\nposter.
\x22Tin Pin Slammer\nSuper Slam-off!!!\nMighty warriors,\nslam forth!\x22
Ohh. It's for\nTin Pin Slammer.
Seems like\neverybody's\nplaying that\nthese days.
Tin Pin Slammer,\nhuh...
Just some\nstupid game.
OK!
Enough\nself-pity.
I have a job\nto do, and I'm\ngoing to do it!
Persistence\npays off!
First, I need to\nfind a ticket to the\nTin Pin slam-off.
Uhh...first,\nyou need to do\nyour job.
I'd better\nhunker down\nand check the\npavement!
...Classy.
Where is all\nthis merchandise\ncoming from?
First\n\x22Reaper Creeper,\x22
and now these\n\x22Red Skull\x22 pins.
I'm not one to\nturn business\naway,
but something\nabout this mystery\nsupplier...
It smells\nrisky...
Hmm...
What should\nI do?
I know! I'll ask\n\x22Reaper Creeper\x22!
What's up\nwith that\nguy?
Reaper...
Creeper...
Is he having\na stroke?
Hmm...\nIt looks like\nsome kind of\ndivination.
See how he put\nthat ten-yen coin\non the paper?
He's going to\nmake a decision\nbased on where\nit moves.
You mean\nwhere HE\nmoves it.
It's not\ngonna move\non its own.
Unless we\nplayed a little\ntrick.
Think you\ncould use your\npsychs
to give\nthe coin a\nlittle push?
Whoa!\nIt just took off!
Nah...\nI must have\nimagined it.
Let's try\nthis again...
Aha!\nThen I was right!
Umm...\nMaybe we were\na little too\nconvincing.
Let's\nmove on...
Say...\nMina...
Hmm?\nWhat's up?
Ever heard of\n\x22Reaper Creeper\x22?
Reaper\nCreeper...
Oh, yeah!
That magic\ngame people were\ntalking about at\nschool, right?
The one that\nanswers your\nquestions!
Wanna\ntry it?
Sure!\nSounds like\nfun!
They're going\nto use Reaper\nCreeper...
Neku.\nShould we\nfake it?
OK, let's\nmove the\ncoin
and rig the\nanswers.
If we want\nthem to patch\nthings up--
Ai needs\nto know the\ntruth.
What!?
But...\nthat's really\nrisky.
Ai suspects\nMina.
She thinks\nMina is after\nthe boy she\nlikes.
If she finds\nout Mina has\nbeen lying,
their friendship\nis sunk!
Exactly.\nThat Mina\ngirl is lying.
And Ai is gonna\nfind out eventually,\nwhether we cover\nit up or not.
Better we\nclear things\nup now.
Well...
I don't know...
Lying isn't\nright.
......
Yeah...
We may want\nto get our facts\nstraight first.
Hey, Ai,\nyou sure this\nisn't phony?
Very sure.
I saw it move\nyesterday!
OK, then.
Let's give it\nanother try.
Aww...\nYou saw us?
Yes!\nI know all\nabout you.
You and\nMakoto and\nyour little--
Here.
What...\nTwo tickets?
How could\nyou, Mina...
You knew I\nliked Makoto.
I'm sorry.
I just\nwanted to\nhelp.
...What?
Makoto wants\nto go to the Molco\nslam-off.
But he couldn't\nget a ticket.\nHe told me\nyesterday.
So I\nstarted mailing\nmy friends.
I figured,\nyou know,
maybe if\nI scored two\ntickets...
Oh, Mina.\nYou didn't...
You and\nMakoto go have\na great time.
You got\nthem for me?
Yup!\nNow you can\nput the moves on\nhim, hee hee.
Mina...\nI'm so sorry...
I totally got\nthe wrong\nidea...
No worries.
It's partly\nmy fault for\nfibbing to you.
We're friends.\nWhat's one little\nargument?
...Yeah.
Neku!\nThe Noise are\nthinning out.
Good!\nLet's finish\nthe job.
Timer's\ngone.
Whew!\nMission complete.
Looks like\nAi and Mina\nmade up, too.
Hey, let me take\nyou out to eat.\nIt's the least I\ncan do.
Really?\nAwesome!
How about\nsundaes?
Sure!\nLet's hit that\nfamily restaurant\nup the street.
OK!
Aww...
See how\nnice it is to\nhave friends?
No.
Sure, you\nmay butt heads\nnow and then,
but life is\nmore fun\nthat way.
Fun? Right.\nEvery time you\nargue,
you end up\nmeeting halfway\nand getting\nnowhere.
What's fun\nabout letting\nother people\nhold you back?
I don't see\nthe point of a\nrelationship built\non lies.
......
Neku...
You don't\nlie to MAKE\nfriends.
I agree,\nthat wouldn't\nbe right.
But sometimes,
you need to\ntell a fib because\nyou ARE friends.
Not all\nsecrets are\nbad secrets.
......
Her and\nthat photo...
Hey.\nNeku?
Yesterday\nyou said we were\nbetter off without\nfriends.
You really\nthink so?
......
Eri used to\ndo everything\nfor me.
There was\nnothing she\nCOULDN'T do.
She had a\nton of friends.\nEverybody at\nschool loved her,
because\nshe was so\noutgoing.
And the outfits\nshe designed were\nso cute.
Eri was the one\nwho got me started\nmaking clothes.
I thought\nthat pig of yours\nwas the reason.
He's a CAT!\nUgh. Anyway...
She saw me\nmaking Mr. Mew.\nAnd then she\nsaid:
\x22Wow, you're\nreally good with a\nneedle.\x22
So we got\nto talking,
and she let me\nhelp her make\nclothes.
I owe her\neverything.
She gave\nme purpose.
Meeting her,\ntalking to her,\ngetting to know\nher...
Admiring her...
It made\nme want to\nbe something\nmore.
......
Rhyme said\nshe didn't know\nwhat dreams\nare like.
And now she\nnever will...
Neku,\nit's not fair.
I know...\nI...I'm sad,\ntoo.
We'll just have to\nlive a little extra.\nFor her sake.
Yeah.
If we get a\nsecond chance.
Second\nchance?
Hello,\nyoung lady.
Who's\nthere?
A Reaper!
Correct.\nBut not just\nany Reaper.
I am\nYodai Higashizawa...\nGame Master\nby proxy.
Game Master...
So you're\nin charge?
Correct\nagain.
Then Rhyme\nis gone because\nof you!
I detest\nleftovers.
No Players\nwere meant to\nescape yesterday's\nchowder of\ndestruction.
Do you know\nwhy you alone\nsurvived?
......
Because\nyou are\nstrong.
It's a\ndog-eat-dog\nworld.
A logical\nhierarchy,\nmuch like the\nfood chain.
The strong\nreach the top\nand win the\nGame,
while the\nweak are\nleft behind,
the heels of\nthe proverbial\nloaf.
How dare you!
Rhyme\nprotected Beat!\nYou call that\nweak?
Take it back!
I admire your\ncourage and loyalty,\nyoung lady.
Delectable.
This calls for\na taste test!
Let us see\nhow you fare\nas fare for the\nNoise!
Heh heh...\nI see I've sunk\nmy teeth into\nsomething good.
We'll never\nlose to you!
You'll pay\nfor what you\ndid to Rhyme!
Sadly, I've had my\nfill for the day.
I only\ncame here
to meet you,\nyoung lady.
Me?\n...Why?
To get a\ncloser look,\nof course.
At the charcoal-\nblack envy beneath\nthe barbecue of\nyour heart.
I...I don't\nunderstand.
Oh, don't you,\nthough?
You can't\nfool me.
You know\nthe feelings are\nthere, so you\nbury them.
Your talk of\nloyalty, of dreams\nand friendship...
They're no\nmore than a lid\non your stir-fry\nof jealousy.
Oh, how\ndeeply you must\nhate yourself.
You have\nEXACTLY what\nyou always\nwanted...
but it's\nnot enough,\nis it?
......
No one\nloves you.
You can't\nlove yourself.
And so the\njealousy consumes\nyou.
Stop it!
That friendly\nsugar coating
can't sweeten\nthe selfishness\ninside you.
You think you're \nmore important than\nanyone else.
And THAT'S\nwhere jealousy\nbegins...
No...\nI'm not--
You are.
And you\nknow it.
Why else\nwould your entry\nfee be--
Stop!\nDon't say it!
Heh heh...\nThat complex of\nyours is a bruise\non the tomato of\nyour soul.
No, I...\nI'm just...
Nothing will\nchange if you are\nrestored to life.
You'll just go\non hating yourself\nand being jealous of\neverybody else.
No. Please,\nno more...
Restored\nto life?
What the\nhell are you\ntalking about!?
You're dead.\nDidn't you\nknow?
I'm...\nI'm dead?
All the\nPlayers are.
The Reapers' Game\nis an examination,
to see who\nis worthy of a\nsecond chance\nat life.
......
Now, if I may\nbe excused...
See you on\nDay 7.\nKeep it fresh.
Take care,\nyoung lady.
I'm...\nI'm d-d-dead?
How?
When did I...
I'm DEAD!?
Where...?
Back at the\nscramble...
What's\nthis?
A new pin?
Where'd it\ncome from?
It looks kind\nof like the\nPlayer Pin.
......
It doesn't\nwork for\nscanning...
Hmph.\nWeird pin.
...Where's\nStalker?
Guess she's\nnot awake\nyet.
Hmm...
Was the\nbig guy\nserious?
Am I really...\ndead?
I don't\nremember\ndying.
But then\nagain, except\nfor my name,
I can't recall\nanything before\nwaking up here\non Day 1.
...What did\nMr. Hanekoma\nsay again?
A special\nShibuya used to\nrun the Game...
And all the Players\ncome here for a\ncommon reason.
Death?
So...I'm dead.\nStalker's dead.
And we're\nall part of some\ncontest to come\nback to life?
...How did\nI die?
What was my\nentry fee?
......
Dammit,\nI can't remember\nany of it.
The\nmission!
\x22Dominate the\nscramble crossing\nview at 3:00.
\x22You have 180\nminutes. Fail, and\nface erasure.\n--The Reapers\x22
Nggh!
Right on\ncue...
Hmm...\nStrange mission.
I'm standing in\nthe scramble\nnow--
but what's\nthe \x22view\x22?
...Dammit.
I don't know\nShibuya well\nenough to make\nsense of this.
When is\nshe gonna\nwake up?
Hey!\nRise and shine!\nThe mission's\nhere.
......
What do you\nmake of this?
\x22Dominate\nthe view\x22?\n...No idea.
Wow. Thanks\nfor giving it all\nthat thought.
What's gotten\ninto her?
Well, wait...\nLook again.\nMaybe there's\na hidden clue.
The scramble\ncrossing at three\no'clock?
Is something\nscheduled to\nhappen?\nOr do we make\nit happen?
Let's start\nby figuring out\nwhat this mission\nmeans.
Sigh...
I'm done for.
What's that\nguy mumbling\nabout?
I can feel time\nslipping through\nmy fingers.
Three more\nhours...
Then I'm gonna\nget the ax.\nSo long, Makoto.\nHeh...
Three more\nhours?
It's noon now...\nso in three\nhours...
it'll be 3:00!
Hey! I think\nthis guy might\nbe the key!
......
T-talk,\ndammit!
Why is she so\nquiet today?
So, um,\nyeah...
Let's scan\nhim. OK?
Catch the eye...
That's it!
Hey!\nThis must be\nour mission!
......
Really?
Think\nabout it.
The time\nmatches up--\n3:00.
And catching\nthe eye...\nEye? View?\nSame thing.
But what's\n\x22Q Floor\x22?
......
Neku.\nUp there...
The big screen--\nthat's Q Floor.
The one playing\ncommercials?
This is all\nstarting to\nmake sense!
So dominating\nthe scramble\ncrossing view
means getting\nthe crowd here\nto watch that\nguy's ad?
It sure seems\nthat way.
......
That'll never\nhappen.
People look\nstraight ahead\nwhen they cross.\nOr at their feet.
Then our\nmission is to\nget them to\nlook UP.
They have to\nsee that ad.
What do\nyou think the\nad's for?
Like I\nknow.
...Maybe he\ncan answer\nthat.
It's all over.
I'm doomed...
Trapped in the\nflaming wreckage\nof my own life...
Great.
I can't read\nhis thoughts...
The Noise\nhave a hold\non him.
You know\nwhat that\nmeans.
......
Chin up, Makoto!\nSnap out of it!
True, these pins\nshow no sign of\nbecoming the next\nbig thing.
But it's my job\nto MAKE them the\nnext big thing!
That pin...
It looks just\nlike this one.
This is what he's\nadvertising?
So maybe\nthis is for the\nmission?
It's just a\nregular old\npin.
No one's\ngonna watch\nan ad for it.
That's\nfor sure.
But the\nguy's a pro,\nright?
I'm sure\nhe's at least\ngot a plan.
OK!\nFirst, I'm going\nto hand free\npins out
and fill Shibuya\nwith walking\nbillboards!
Hmm...and\nto get people's\nattention,
I need some\n\x22hip\x22 one-liners\nlike that book\nsuggested.
Let's see...\nHow about,
\x22Totally gnarly!\x22
\x22Come get some\nhot stuff!\x22
\x22Unreal, bro!\x22
Perfect!\nThe slang of\nthe moment!
If I get\neveryone talking\nabout the pins\nin time,
they're sure\nto watch the\ncommercial!
Uhh...no?
They're\ngoing to think\nyou're nuts.
\x22Come get some\nhot stuff\x22?
That sounds\nlike a pickup\nline...
And pins\naren't exactly\na hot topic to\nbegin with.
No one's\ngoing to take\nthem.
We'd better\nintervene.
......
Wow, I'm on\nfire today!
OK! Time to\nhand these out\nsomeplace else!
Looks like\nit worked.
You really\nthink a pin like\nthis could\ntake off?
It better.\nThat's our\nmission.
...Yeah.
OK!\nThis seems like\na good spot.
Here we go\nagain...
......
Finally!\nAll done.
Now these\npins are sure\nto take off!
I should go see\nwhat people are\nsaying back by\nQ Floor.
So far\nso good.
Let's follow\nhim back to\nthe scramble.
......
Now, to witness\na phenomenon\nin the making!
I bet I'll have\nto BEAT back\nall the fans.
Let me\nwalk around\nand observe.
Oh,\ncome on.
Handing out a\nfew pins isn't\ngoing to ignite\nShibuya.
We better\ngo after him.
......
Just...\ngive it up.
Huh?
Even if we\ndo clear the\nmission...
I'll still...
I'll never be...
Hey!
What's gotten\ninto you?
Man, where\ndoes she think\nshe's going?
OK!\nThis seems like\na good spot.
Here we go\nagain...
......
Hey,\nwhat gives?
......
You've been\nacting really\nweird today.
It's almost 3.
We need to\nget moving,\nor we'll fail\nthe mission.
...So what?
Huh?
There's\nno point.
You heard\nwhat that\nReaper said.
Even if I\nfinish the mission...\nwin the Game...
Even if I\ncome back\nto life...
I'll still\njust be me.
What do\nI do...
What kind\nof question\nis that?
I thought\nI'd changed.
But I'll\nnever change.
I'll just go\non hurting.
Says who?
I was never\npretty...
or smart...
There was\nnothing special\nabout me at all.
I hated\nmyself.
I wanted\nto change,
to be\nsomebody\nelse.
To be Eri.
......
But it\ndidn't work.
I don't--
WHOA!
Over there!\nIs that...\nyou?
Ahh!
The other day,\nI found just the\ncutest outfit at\nTen-Four!
Seriously?
Hey, why\ndon't we head\nover there?
You've still\ngot some time,\nright, Eri?
Eri?\nWhat the...
Hey!\nWait!
I can't\njust leave her\nby herself...
So now\nyou know.
Know what?
What my\nentry fee was.
Huh?
My appearance.
I gave up\nthe way I\nreally look.
Your\nappearance?
Then--
This is\nEri's body.
I don't really\nlook like this.
Oh.\nWow...
When I got\nto the UG
and I saw\nmyself...
I freaked.
Yeah.\nI would, too.
But it was\na happy kind\nof freaked.
Happy?\nWhy?
Because this\nis what I always\ndreamed of--
a new me.
I hated\nwho I was.
All I wanted\nwas to like\nmyself.
To be cute,\nand smart, and\nperfect...
like Eri.
......
Then why would\nthe Reapers take\nyour appearance?
Your entry\nfee is supposed\nto be what you\nvalue most.
But you\njust said you\nhate yourself.
At first...
I didn't get\nit either.
I was so\nexcited to\nbe Eri
that I even\nacted like her--\nall bubbly and\ncute.
But it was\njust an act.
Inside, nothing\nchanged.
I'm still the\nsame person\nI've always\nbeen.
Then I\nrealized.
I'll never\nbe Eri.
Deep down,\nI never wanted\nto be.
I was just\njealous.
The Reaper\nwas right.
What I value\nmost is ME!
......
Eri has all the\nthings I don't.\nLooks, brains,
design sense.\nLots of friends...
I envied\nher.
And now\nthat I'm inside\nher body,
it just hurts\neven more.
......
All this time...
she's been\nas confused\nas me.
The truth is,\nI'm scared!
I keep trying\nto sound brave,
saying we need\nto win the Game,\nbut...
I'm scared of\ngetting a second\nchance!
What if it's\nlike the Reaper\nsaid?
I don't want\nto come back to\nlife if it means\nbeing jealous of\nEri all the time.
......
I don't want\nto be that\nperson.
Well...
I like you\nthe way you\nare.
Huh?
Noooooo!
What the--
No one's\nwearing the\npins!
Why not!?
Looks like\nwe can't relax\nyet.
Listen.\nWe're going\nto finish this\nmission.
So promise\nyou'll focus on\nthat for now.\nOK?
......
All right.
Why isn't\nanybody talking\nabout the pins?
I worked\nso hard...
Hey,\nMick.
Huh?
Oh! Mr. Oji.\nPrince...
I saw you\nstanding here.\nWhy so glum?
It's work.\nI'm going to\nlose my job.
I was supposed\nto make these\npins a sensation.
I gave away\na whole bunch\nfor free.
But they just\nwon't take off.
Aw, Mick,\nyou can't be\nserious.
What?
All right,\nlisten.
You've done\ngood business\nfor me,
so I'll give\nit to you\nstraight.
Your pins\nwon't take off,\nbecause you're\nignoring the\ntrends.
Handing out\nsamples doesn't\nmake something\npopular.
Hmm.\nTrue...
So then how\ndo I change\nthe trends?
Lots of ways.
I mean,\nif you were a\nPrince like me,
just walking\nthe streets\ncould start a\nrevolution.
If people saw\nyou wearing the\npin... Right...
OK.\nI've gotta run.\nPress date.
Take care,\nMick.
You can\ndo it.
Thanks!\nI'll try!
Hmm...\nTrends, eh?
OK!\nIf the Prince\ncan do it,
so can I!
Time to put this\npin on and start\na revolution!
This guy is\ncertifiable...
...But think\nabout it.
Neku,\nif you put the\npin on
and we fought\nsome battles,
we might be\nable to change\nthe trends.
How do you\nfigure?
Rhyme and I\ngot to talking.
We noticed\nwearing pins\nin combat
makes those\nbrands more\npopular.
Even though\nthe RG people\ncan't see us?
Yeah.\nWeird, huh?
All right...
Let's give\nit a try.
Hey!\nIsn't that pin\nthe coolest?
Huh?\nWhere?
There.\nThe one that\nguy's got on.
Oh yeah!\nVery nice.
Wonder\nwhere they\nsell 'em.
Whoa...\nPeople keep\nlooking at me\nand smiling.
Am I...\nI couldn't be...\ntrendy!?
Wow.\nThe Prince\nwas right!
It worked.
So the\npins we wear\nin combat
do change\nwhat's popular\nin the RG.
Uh-huh.
But that\nguy seems to\nhave his own\ntheory.
Get ready,\n104!
Your\ntrend-god\ncometh!
......
He's kind\nof a tool,\nhuh?
OK!\nTime to look\ntrendy!
Yeah, with\na little help.
Hey,\ncheck out\nthat hot pin!
Yeah.\nThe one on\nthat guy?
People were\nwearing it back\nat the scramble\ncrossing.
Seriously?
It's gonna\nbe huge, just\nwait and see.
Wish I\nhad one...
Whoa...
I get it.\nI really get it!
The trends\nare mine to\ncommand!
Now that\nthe word is\nout,
I just need\nto wait for the\nad to run.
Back to\nthe crossing!
Well,\nwe did it.
Did we?
Hey, we\ngave it our\nbest shot.
Let's just\ncross our\nfingers.
......
Neku...
Umm...
I'm sorry.
If we fail,
and it turns\nout to be my\nfault for slowing\nus down...
......
No big deal.
We all,\numm...
Hmm?
We all\nhave our\nbad days.
Thanks.
Hey,\nit's her.
Ahh!
So, Eri.
How come you\nhaven't designed\nanything lately?
......
Actually...\nI'm thinking about\ngiving it up.
What! Why?\nYou're so\ntalented!
She's giving\nit up?
Eri, why...
......
If you\nwant to know,\nscan her.
What?
I can't\ndo that!
She's my\nfriend.
I can't\neavesdrop on\nher thoughts!
Why not?
You've\nscanned tons\nof people.
......
Eri, why\nwould you give\ndesign up?
......
Well, there\nwas this girl,\nShiki--
Neku...
I have\nto go!
Hey!\nJust...wait!
I can't\njust leave her\nby herself...
She went to\nthe crossing.






















I'm...\nI'm sorry.
I didn't want\nto hear Eri\ntalk about me.
I was\nafraid.
......
Eri told me\nsomething before\nI died.
\x22You're not\nmeant to be a\ndesigner,\x22\nshe said.
I never had\nher talent...
I guess she\nfinally got\nfed up and--
Oh, would\nyou cut the\ncrap?
Who ARE\nyou?
Huh?
You're\nyou.
You're not\nEri.
You'll never\nbe Eri.
You'll only\never be you.
But she's so\nmuch better--
Forget her!
You need\nto live your\nown life.
If she can\ndo it, so can\nyou.
All that\nmatters is that\nyou try.
......
Neku--
You're lucky\nyou're jealous.
It gives you\nsomething to\nshoot for.
So...\nshoot.
......
You're right.
Thanks,\nNeku.
It's time.\nThe commercial's\nabout to air.
Sooo\nnervous...
Will people\nwatch?
Neku...
Don't worry.
They'll\nwatch.
Hey!\nUp there!
That pin.\nWho designed it?\nIt looks like--
Hey,\ncool graphic.
I never wear pins.\nBut this one...
Where can\nI buy it?
Hey, man,\nlook what\nI got.
You HAVE one?\nAw, lucky...
Oh, I know\nthat pin!
Ha ha.\nYou would,\nEri.
Wish I\nhad one...
Eri...
......
Neku,\ncan I have\na minute?
I want to\ngo stand by\nher.
Hey,\nyou're off\nthe clock.
...Thanks!
Eri, you\nshouldn't give\nup design.
I told you.
This girl,\nShiki--
I'm nothing\nwithout her.
Huh?
Yeah, you\nsaid that.
What, did\nyou two have\na fight?
A fight?
I wish.
Shiki died.\nIn an accident\nthe other day.
Oh...\nI'm so sorry.
No one else\ncould ever make\nmy outfits.
Shiki gave\nthem life.\nMade them\nreal.
You must\nhave trusted\nher a lot.
I did!\nShe was an\namazing\nperson.
She cared\nabout people--\nand always noticed\nthe little things.
If I missed some-\nthing in my design,\nShiki always picked\nup the slack.
And her\nstuffed animals!\nI wouldn't know\nwhere to begin.
She had a\nsharp eye,\nskilled hands.\nMotivation.
All the things\nI don't have.
The way you\ntalk about her,
she must\nhave been\nsomething.
......
The day\nbefore her\naccident...
I said\nsomething I'll\nalways regret.
What?
She was upset\n'cause she couldn't\ncome up with a\ngood design.
I wanted\nto cheer her\nup...
so I told her,\n\x22You're not\nmeant to be a\ndesigner.\x22
I mean, she\nhad such a great\nfuture as a\nseamstress.
But I think\nI really hurt\nher feelings.
I planned to\napologize the\nnext day...
but I\nnever saw\nher again.
......
She's still my\nbest friend.\nEven now.
I want her\nback,
so I can\ntell her I'm\nsorry...
and so we\ncan be a team\nagain.
......
I had no idea.
I never knew\nshe felt that\nway about me.
Guess you\ntwo both need\neach other.
Neku...
You think\nI'm OK the\nway I am?
Hey, Shibuya's\ngot room for\nall types.
Who else\nis gonna make\nstuffed piggies?
He's a cat!\nHeh heh...
Neku...
I want to\nsee Eri again.
So we can\nbe a team.
I'm ready\nfor a second\nchance!
All right.\nThen whatever\nit takes...
Let's win...\nLet's live.\nJust one more\nday!
We're on\nschedule.
Yes, sir!
Three Players\nremain.
Tomorrow\nI shall ice them\npersonally.
I look forward\nto it.
See this\nweek's Game\nthrough to its\nconclusion,
and your\npromotion to\nGame Master\nis assured.
As your\nproxy, sir,\nI promise you\nI will not fail.
You know,\nenough with this\n\x22proxy\x22 business.
Too formal.
I hereby grant\nyou full GM privileges.\nYou've proven you\ncan handle it.
Sir!
You are far\ntoo kind!
I will check\nin again after\ntomorrow's\nrepast.
Why?
Why can't\nI use you?
Yo, there's\ngotta be a\nway.
......
THEY\nknow.
They gotta\nknow!
Yo, I am done\nsittin' here\ncollectin' dust!
Well, time\nto get\ncracking.
I just hope\nthey can\npull it off.
......
Back to\nthe café,\nI guess.
Beat must\nbe starving\nby now.
This is it...\nDay 7.
Yup.\nToday we\nwin this.
There it is!
The last\nmission.
\x22The Game\nMaster awaits you\non the freeway.\nDefeat him.
\x22You have 600\nminutes. Fail, and\nface erasure.\n--The Reapers\x22
Oww!
The Game Master\nis that big Reaper,\nright?
We need to\npay him back\nfor Rhyme.
Yeah...
C'mon.\nWe've got a\nGame to win.\nFor Beat...
and for us!
Who could\nbe calling us\nnow?
Think it's the\nReapers?
Hello?\nDead kid\nspeaking.
Phones!\nThat you?
Mr. Hanekoma?
Listen!\nBeat, he...\nhe's gone!
Gone!?
You don't\nmean...
No, no...\nNot erased.\n...Not yet.
What's that\nsupposed to\nmean?
Look, he\nmusta left the\ncafé while I\nwas out.
He left?
Why!?
I dunno why.
Look, enough\nquestions.
You gotta\nhurry!
That kid ain't\ngot a partner\nto fight with.
He's Reaper-chow\nthe second they\nspot him.
'Sides...\nToday's Day 7.
The GM can\nattack Players\ndirectly now!
And he will.\nBelieve me.
Son of a--
Hey, hey,\nhave a little\nfaith.
You're almost\nthere! Just put an\nend to the Game!
You do that and\nSkater-Brain might\njust survive this.
Right,\ngot it.
Neku, what's\ngoing on?
Is Beat in\ntrouble?
Yeah...
But we can\nstill save him if\nwe end the\nGame in time.
Then let's\nmove it!
That\nmeathead!
Has he lost\nhis mind!?
Why couldn't\nhe just stay with\nMr. Hanekoma?
Neku!\nLet's get over to\nthe freeway!
It's not far\nfrom the station\nunderpass!
Crap!\nWall's up!
Quick!\nThere's the\nReaper!
Clear!
Go, go, go!
Six days and\nyou're still kickin'.\nI'm impressed.
A Reaper...
Hey, clear\nthe road!
We're in\na hurry!
Oh, I'll clear\nthe road--
of YOU,\nthat is.
Hey hey...\nDon't run off.
Where's the\nlove, guys?
A Reaper...
Move!\nWe're in a\nhurry!
Six days and\nyou're still kickin'.\nI'm impressed.
I said\nMOVE!
Aww, sorry.\nNo dice.
It's a race\nto erase, and I\naim to place.\nSo long...
Dammit...
That cost\nus time.
I hope\nBeat's OK.
Worrying won't\nsave him.
C'mon.\nWe're still\nin this.
Right!
Let's shut\ntheir Game\ndown!
Bleh.
Day 7 is\nsuch a yawn.
Not enough\nPlayers left,\nyou know?
See?\nThis is why I\npace myself.
Work too hard\nand you run out\nof work.
Yeah...\nWe did rack up\na ton of points\nthis week.
And on the\nseventh day...\nwe rest.
The first of\nmany days off,\nI hope.
Yo...
Who's there?
...You!?
We toasted\nyour partner--
you should\nbe smoke by\nnow!
Make another\npact?
......
So, like,\nwhat?
You thirsty\nfor revenge?
No!
...Huh?
Then what do\nyou want?
Answers.
Tell me\nwhat I need\nto know!
You do\nrealize...
you're in no\nposition to make\ndemands?
......
I could erase\nyou with my\nlittle finger.
......
Aight,\nSkulls...
You ask.\nMaybe we'll\nanswer.
Hey...\nKariya!!!
What does\nit take?
How do you\nReapers do it!?
Game Master's\njust ahead...
Finally...
the end is\nin sight.
It's been\ncrazy, huh?
Our time in\nthe UG.
But I learned\nsomething about\nmyself--
how lucky\nI was.
I took\neach day for\ngranted.
Woke up,\nwent to school,\ntalked to Eri.
Came home, ate,\nwatched TV.\nThen conked right\nout.
It was so...\nNORMAL,
I never\nthought of it\nas living.
But this\nweek woke\nme up,
made me feel\nmore alive...
than I ever\ndid when I\nreally was.
......
The best is\nstill ahead.
Once we\nwin, and come\nback to life.
Yeah!
Neku...
Thanks for these\nlast seven days.
You're pretty\ngood at this\npartner thing.
Pfft...\nSave it for when\nwe win, OK?
...Ready for\nthe big boss?
You know it.
Hey, if we\nmake it through\nthis...
let's meet up\nin the RG.\nYou, me, and\nBeat.
You might\nnot recognize\nme, so...
I know!
I'll bring\nMr. Mew\nwith me.
We can be a\nteam again!
I'll...think\nit over.
Heh heh.
OK.\nLet's finish\nthis!
You're late.
A shame I had\nto set the table\nbefore cooking\nthe main dish.
We're not on\nthe menu.
You are!
Ah, hello there,\nyoung lady.
I've been\nwaiting for\nthis day.
......
What's\nthis?
The jealousy in\nyour heart--
my secret\nspice!
It's...\ngone.
Lost your\nappetite?
But...you\nwere green\nwith envy!
Begrudging to\na light golden\nbrown!
So deliciously\njealous...
That's right.\nI was jealous.
That's how\nlucky I am!
It takes an\namazing friend\nto make you\njealous.
So you can\njust get ready\nto lose!
You tell him!
I swear I'm\ngetting my life\nback!
Eri's waiting\nin the RG,\nand you...
are NOT\ngonna get in\nmy way!
You've gone\nstale, young\nlady.
But no\nmatter.
A true chef\ncan whip up a\ntoothsome\nmeal
even from\nthe basest of\ningredients!
Mr. Kitaniji\nhas given me\na recipe...
and I intend\nto cook it.
Now...
prepare to\nbe spicy tuna\nrolled!!!
......
In...indigestible!
I lost?
Well done...\nyoung lady...
Game over.
That's it?
We did it!\nWe won!
Woo-hoo!\nNow we'll come\nback to life!
Wh-what's\ngoing on?
Shiki?
Huh?
I don't think\nthis light is bad.
Yeah...
Feels almost\nlike a...pat on\nthe back.
A warm\nwelcome back\nto the world\nof the living!
And you\nsaid \x22Shiki\x22!
Neku...
That's the\nfirst time you\nused my name.
Oh, really?
Neku?
See you on\nthe other side.
You know\nthe meeting\nplace.
Hachiko!
Heh.\nIt's a date.
Why...
Why,\nwhy, why...
WHYYYYYY!
......
Huh?\nWhat's this box?
......
Oh, snap!
Reach 104.\nYou have 60 minutes.\nFail, and face erasure.\n                --The Reapers
