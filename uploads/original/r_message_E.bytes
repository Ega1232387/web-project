The scramble\ncrossing...
He expects\nme to just\nstart over?
What the hell\nwere the last\nseven days\nfor, then?
......
Fine.\nWhat's the\nmission?
I'm not losing.
Not now.\nNot a chance.
\x22Game I:\nπ = 30 + 74
\x22θ = 60 min.\nIncompletes will\nbe destroyed.\x22
Nngh!
There's the\ntimer...
The mission\nformat's different.\nπ = 30 + 74...
They're giving\nout Algebra\nhomework now?
Hmm, we did\ntake down the\nGM last week.
Maybe this is\nthe big guy's\nreplacement.
Better not\ncount on the same\ntricks, then...
I've got to\nstay focused--
and stay\nalive.\nToo much is\non the line.
First, I need\na partner--
the toughest\nPlayer I can\nfind!
Hmm...
Hachiko!
I'm bound to\nfind somebody\nuseful there.
Ugh.\nIt's like a\nsick joke.
They expect\nus to work this\nweek, too?
Oh, suck\nit up!
Don't you\nwant the extra\npoints?
Though it is\na little weird to\ngo two weeks\nin a row...
Guess there's\na first time for\neverything.
Not quite a first.
Been a while,\nthough.
You prob'ly\nweren't here,\nspring chicken\nthat you are.
Spring chicken?
Been here two\nyears, and I'm a\nspring chicken?
Just how long\nhave you been\ndoing this?
Meh.\nDetails!
Uh-huh.
Anyway.\nWhat do you\nsuppose the\nGM is--
Yashiro\nhere.
......
What!?
You want us\nto WHAT!?
Grraaah!
Easy, girl!\nWhat's the deal?
Standby!\nWe're just\nsupposed to\nsit here!
This is an insult!
Take it down\na notch before\nyou pop a\nblood vessel.
I don't see\na problem.\nThis is our week\noff, after all.
Ugh! This is why\nI hate the way\nhe runs things!
Really?\nI kinda like it.
What's to like!?
It's one big,\ncryptic mess!\nIt pisses me off!
He can't help it.
I'm sure he's\nworked out some\ncrazy plan--
something way\nbeyond the ken\nof mundane folks\nlike you 'n' me.
I mean, c'mon--
he's the type of\ngenius head case\nthat makes stuff\nlike THIS.
Come on...\nThere has to be\nsomeone!
I need this...
I have to win!
...For her\nsake, and\nmine.
Now come on!\nI gotta find me\na powerhouse!
Grr, Noise!?
Dammit!\nI can't do much\non my own!
Isn't there\nanybody--
Huh?
What was\nthat!?
A pact?
With who!?
Howdy.
Who the--
The name's\nYoshiya Kiryu.
But Mother\nand Father call\nme Joshua.
Please don't\ntell me...
I guess you\ncan call me\nJoshua, too--
seeing as how\nyou're my dear,\ndear partner.
Hee hee...
Your what!?
This pipsqueak is\nmy new partner!?
You seem\nlike such a pro\nat this, I just...\nhelped myself.
A pro?
How could you\nknow that?
I've been\nwatching\nyou, silly.
Very impressive,\nby the way.
Huh?\nWas he a Player\nlast time, too?
But wait...\nNo, there was\nnobody like him\nat the end.
Who the hell\nIS this kid?
Today's the first\nday and all...
Let's just\ntake it easy,\nhmm?
Why don't you\nstart by giving\nthe area a scan,\npartner?
F-fine.
Something about\nhim just...grates.
What's wrong?
Don't tell me\nyou've forgotten\nhow to scan?
Just touch your\nPlayer Pin.\nSimple, hmm?
Hee hee...
Look, I...\nI know, OK?
Ugh!\nSmug little...
Going somewhere?
Step one is to\ncollect some info.
Give the\narea a scan,\nwould you?
Or have you\nalready forgotten\nhow?
Uhhh, no?\nI know what I'm\ndoing, all right?
Hee hee...
Then what's\nthe holdup?
Obnoxious\nlittle...
Scan your damn\nself, if you're in\nsuch a hurry!
Nngh!\n...What?
What did I\njust see?
That place\nlooked like...\nthe Udagawa\ndistrict?
Something\nwrong?\nAre we not\nfeeling well?
Wait,\ndid I...
did I just\nscan him?
Is this going\nto be a problem?\nI need you to\npull it together.
Unlike some\npeople, I'm new\nat all this.
I'm expecting\na bang-up job\nfrom you,\nMr. Escort.
...I'll be\nfine.
Will you?\nWonderful.\nThen can we\ngo?
Something's\nweird here...
How was I able\nto scan him?
He's a\nPlayer.
Hmm?\nWhat's the\nholdup, Neku?
It's nothing.
Don't tell me\nyou're still\nstuck on the\nmission mail.
Please.\nIt's painfully\nobvious.
......
π marks the spot.\n[#FF0000]30 + 74[#000000], Neku.
We're headed\nto [#FF0000]104[#000000].
If you ever\nfind yourself\nstumped,
I'd be happy\nto help you\nalong. Just say\nthe word.
I promise you\nmy advice is\nspot-on.
Lucky you,\nhaving me as\nyour partner.
I'm going to\nchoke this kid.
Oh! I can't say\nI'm particularly\ninterested, but...
I'll go ahead and\nask, for the sake\nof convenience.
Do you have\na name?
......
Neku.
Neku, hmm?
Hee hee...\nCharming.
Gaaah!
Well then, Neku.\nShall we?




Another wall...
So we need to\nclear out a few\nNoise to get by.
All right.\nWhat better time\nto go over my\ncombat skills?
Don't\nworry--
I think even you\nshould be able to\nfollow along.
He has to be\ndoing this on\npurpose...
Put simply,\nI play things by\nthe numbers.
By the\nnumbers?
You should be\nable to pick it\nup on the fly.
Ready for a\nlittle warm-up?
Then let's\nbegin, hmm?
All right.\nThat's fine.
We'll wait until\nyou're ready\nto go, Neku.
Well?\nGet the basic\ngist of it?
Care to give\nit another go?
Hee hee...
If you\ninsist.
We're in this\ntogether from\nnow on.
You watch my\nbehind, I'll watch\nyours.
Sound good,\npartner?\nHee hee...
......
Timer's gone...\nWe're safe.
That's one\nday down...
Neku...\nWhat do you\nsuppose that\nis?
What the\nhell?
That junk\nheap wasn't\nhere before!
You're zetta\nslow!
What!?
Who said\nthat?
Don't look at me.\nLook at your\njunk heap there.
There's\nsomebody up\nthere?
I said, you're\nzetta slow!
How long does\nit take to crack a\nZ-class code,
you factoring\nhectopascals!
Hecto-what?
Nngh!\nMy...head!
Sho Minamimoto.\nRemember the\nname.
I'm the new\nGame Master.
Then you're\na Reaper.
Wait. You...
You're a Player\nthis time around?
Nngh, who...\nme?
Hmph.\nNow that's a\nhappy\nmiscalculation.
This brings\nme one iteration\ncloser to my\ndesired solution!
Solution?\n...Nngh!\nWhat are you\ntalking about?
Day 1, and\nthe GM's already\nputting in an\nappearance?
Not one\nfor tradition,\nare you?
Hee hee...
Tradition?\nTradition is\ngarbage!
CRUNCH!
I'll add it to\nthe heap!
This is my Game.
And I only\nallow two things.\nFlawless\ncalculations...
and beauty!
I'd heard you\nwere quite the\neccentric...
Some Old Horses\nCan Always Hear\nTheir Owner\nApproach.
Now,\ntime for a\nlittle quiz.
How much\nweight will I let\nyou Players\ncarry in the UG?
Pray tell.
One yoctogram!
Yoctogram?
Nice.\nThat puts us\non the atomic\nlevel?
Precisely!
You 000s have\nno value here.
So!
Now that\nI have you\nrounded up...
Attention, all\nyoctograms!
(It's × 2)\nDIE!
Whew...
Well, so much\nfor Day 1.
That Reaper\nknew me...
How?
Rather\nfascinating,\nwasn't he?
Uhh...
At least we\nwon't be too\nbored this week,\nhmm?
This kid,\ntoo...
There's something\nseriously not right\nabout him.
I wonder what\nthe little math\nfetishist will think\nup for tomorrow.
Exciting times,\nhuh, Neku?
Hmph.
He's shady...
Still, \x22trust\nyour partner,\x22\nright?
I need him if\nI'm gonna survive\nthe UG--
if I'm gonna\nWIN.
Better get\nused to it.
Well, the two\nof us should be\nable to cruise\nright through this\nweek--
between your\npsychs,
my inspired\nbrilliance,
and our\nexcellent\nteamwork.
Hee hee...
Ugh, I'll never\nget used to\nthis!
But I'll deal\nwith the devil\nif that's what\nit takes.
...This time's\nfor keeps.
Hang in there,\nShiki.
Nope. No luck.\nThis one's not\nopening either.
Well, thanks\nanyway.
You're dismissed.
He's sealed off\nRoute 1...\nHoo, boy.
Hey, Kariya!
Any luck?
Routes 2, 5,\nand 6 are all\nsealed.
Gotta hand it\nto him, the guy\nworks fast.
He could've\ntold us what areas\nare open.
What the\nhell is he\nthinking?
Are we, like,\ncompletely\ninsignificant?
Rrgh! That man\nseriously frosts\nmy cookies.
Naw, it's nice\nto see the boss\ndo the legwork.
I say we kick\nback and enjoy\nthe show.
Well I say this\nis a work week.\nIt would be nice\nto actually work!
The Players\nare right there!\nBut nooo, he\nsays hands off.
I'll tell you what\nI'd like to put my\nhands around!
I sure hope it's\nyour mouth.
Hmm... Maybe\nI should just hop\nover to the RG.
Use this baby\nto recruit a few\nnew Players...
Whoa there,\ncowgirl.\nReapers whackin'\nfolks in the RG\nis a no-no.
Don't be stupid.\nI'm joking!\n...Mostly.
I'm just\nsaying we may\nbe forced to...\nif we want any\npoints.
You keep talking\nabout work, work,\nwork. It's--
......
Impossible!
Exactly!\nWe can't go\non like this.
I'm THIS close\nto a promotion,\nbut nooo...
Honestly, I\ndon't even know\nwhy I try some--
Uzuki!\nLook out!!!
Nngh...\nWhere...?
Back at\nthe scramble\ncrossing...
Where's that\nother kid?
Are we still\non track with\nthe goods?
What?\nYou already got\nthem in!?
Oh, he's on\nthe phone.
Wait a minute...
How did he\nplace a call!?\nAnd who's he\ntalking to?
The scramble...\nWhich areas?\n...Sealed?
In that case...\n...and the time\nlimit at...
And?\nAnything else?
Wait, is he\nreporting in to\nthe Reapers?
Definitely\nshady...
I can't tell\nwhat he's\nthinking.
......
Or can I?
Maybe another\nscan will turn\nsomething up.
Right.
I know,\nI know...
Joshua...
Who is he\ntalking to, and\nabout what?
......
This calls\nfor a scan.
As much as\nI'd love to\nditch his ass,
I can't clear\nthe mission\nwithout him.
Right...
Exactly,\nso...
I need to\ntrust him,\nbut...
Ugh, how?
Something's not\nright about him.\nI know it.
Maybe I can\nscan him.
Huff...huff...
That was...\nme?
Why was I\npassed out in\nUdagawa?
And...why\nwas that in\nHIS head!?
Udagawa...
I can't\nremember...
Wait!
Was I dead?
Did I...\ndid I die in\nUdagawa?
That would mean...
He saw me die.\nHe was there!
Or...
Maybe he did\nmore than just\nwatch.
......
One way to\nfind out.
But no...\nI can't just\nask him.
If that sparks\nsome huge fight,\nI'm screwed.
We need to work\ntogether to clear\nthese missions.
I can't afford\nto risk it.
Still...\nhe knows\nsomething.
The mission!
Hmm?\nWas that the\nmission, Neku?
What? Oh...\nYeah.
For now, I\ncan only watch\nand wait.
The mission\nsays to--
Say, Neku.\nI have a little\nproposal.
...What?
Let's play\nhooky today.\nForget about\nthe mission.
What!?\nAre you crazy?
If we don't\ndo this, we\nget erased!
But there's\nsomeplace I\nreeeally want\nto go.
Let the other\nPlayers take care\nof the mission.
It's not as if\nwe have to do\neverything.
Yes, we do!
I can't afford\nto screw around\non this!
I'm not\nletting anything\njeopardize this\nGame.
Oh, don't\nget so wound\nup, Neku.
It's only\nDay 2!\nEnjoy it while\nit's still easy.
I'm not just\nplaying this for\nme anymore!
Her life is on\nthe line, too.
...Where are we?
It's too\nbright...\nI can't see a\nthing.
Yo...
Beat!
You're safe!
Yeah.\nYou too,\nhuh?
......
Why'd you run\noff on your own\nlike that?
You had\nus all so\nworried!
I...I jus'\nhad to...
Look, yo...\nmy bad.\nI jus' had to\ntake off.
......
So...\nAre we...alive\nagain?
I'm afraid\nnot.
Not yet,\nanyway.
Who's there!?
Hello, and\ncongratulations.\nYou all are\nthe victors.
How did you\nfind our Game?\nEnjoyable?
You're...
Megumi Kitaniji.\nConductor of\nthe Game,
and loyal\nservant to the\nComposer.
Conductor of...\nThen he's the\nhead Reaper?
Now then,\nregarding your\nfates...
As per the\nComposer's\nmandate,
the number of\nPlayers to be\ngiven new life\nthis round is...
One.
Huh!?
What did\nyou say?
But that's...\nthat's cruel!
I thought\neveryone got\nto come back!
Any and all\nspecifics are\ndecided by the\nComposer.
That is His\nexclusive and\nincontrovertible\nright.
Why do you\nthink we came\nthis far!?\nTo live again!
Every last\none of us\nwanted to--
Hold up!
Not exactly...
Not exactly\nwhat?
Not everybody...\nI...
......
I ain't\ngoin' back.
What!?
I...
I wanna be\na Reaper!
So how\n'bout it, yo?\nMake me part\na' your crew!
Wha...\nBeat!?
......
Very well.
Your wish\nis within my\nauthority to\ngrant.
The Reapers\nwelcome you.
......
Beat!\nWhy!?
Hey, wait!\nBEAT!
Why would\nBeat want\nto join the\nReapers?
The hour\nof reckoning\ndraws near.
Your points have\nbeen tallied, and\nthe Player to be\nreborn decided.
Congratulations...
Shiki Misaki.
M-me!?
But...\nI can't...
I'm not going\nback alone--
I can't!\nIt's unfair!
And why me!?
We grade Players\naccording to their\nperformance during\nthe missions.
You scored\nthe highest.
But that\ncan't be right!
Neku is way\nbetter with\npsychs than me!
And the riddles--\nhe solved most\nof those, too.
He should\nbe the one\nto go back!
......
If only one of\nus gets a second\nchance...
what happens\nto the one left\nbehind?
If you still\ncling to life, you\nmay reenter\nthe Game.
If you lean\ntoward destruction,\nyou may join your\nfriend as a Reaper.
Otherwise,\nshould you welcome\noblivion, erasure is\nalso an option.
......
Shiki...
You go on\nahead.
No way!
Just go!\nTrust me.
I'm not leaving\nwithout you,\nNeku!
I'll enter the\nGame again.
Let Neku--
Out of the\nquestion.
As I mentioned\na moment ago.
this was decided\nby the Composer\nHimself.
Your wishes\ndon't mean a\ndamn.
No way...
Shiki...
Don't worry\nabout me.
But Neku--
Didn't you\nswear you'd go\nback and see\nEri again?
......
I still don't\neven know\nhow I died.
I don't know if\nI have anything\nto go back to.
You do,\nShiki.
Neku...
You're not gonna\nstart slipping back\nnow, are you?
Huh?
Back to the\nold Shiki.
N-no...
......
I'm so sorry,\nNeku.
Thank you.
I'll go back--\nback to the\nreal me.
There you go.
I'll be waiting\nfor you--
every day,\nin front of\nHachiko...till you\ncome back.
I'll see you\nthere soon.\nThat's a\npromise.
Finished your\ngoodbyes, then?
Neku!
Once you see\nthe real me,\nwill we still\nbe friends?
Count on it.\nYou'll always\nbe Shiki.
Neku!\nI...
Shiki...
And now\nit's your\nturn.
You seem to\nhave your mind\nmade up.
Damn straight.
I'll play your\nGame again.
Excellent.\nNo doubt you'll\nmake it an\nexciting one.
Then before\nthe next Game\nbegins...
allow me\nto return your\nprevious entry\nfee.
Nnnnnngh!!!
Huff...huff...
What...\nWhat the hell\ndid you just\ndo to me!?
I simply\nreturned to you\nwhat is yours.
Fair is fair.
Nngh, I get\nit now...
This explains\na lot.
My memory...\nwas gone...
because you\ntook it!
Indeed.
Memories are\nthe single greatest\ndeterminant of a\nperson's identity.
A worthy\nentry fee,\nwouldn't you\nsay?
Hey...\nWait just a...
Where's the\nrest!?
Beg pardon?
It's missing!
How did I die!?
I still can't\nremember\nanything about\nmy own death!
I was looking\nup at the\ntag mural in\nUdagawa...
Then the next\nthing I remember\nis waking up in\nthe scramble!
Oh really?\nMost\nfascinating...
Cut the crap!\nYou're the one\nwho...
HOWEVER.\nThat has nothing\nto do with\nthe Game.
What!?
I returned\nyour memory in\nits entirety.
If you still\ncan't recall\nsomething,
well...
you must never\nhave had it in\nthe first place.
I never...?
What could\nI possibly stand\nto gain from\ndepriving you of\nthat memory?
Hmm?
...He's right.
So why is\nthat the only\nhole in my\nmemory?
Now then.\nAs for your new\nentry fee--
You're taking my\nmemory again!?
A Player's\nentry fee is that\nwhich they hold\nmost dear.
That is\nthe rule.
I've already\ntaken the liberty\nof collecting\nyours.
What!?
This time,\nyou're playing\nfor...
Shiki Misaki.
WHAT!?
That's not...
NOOOOO!
I...
......
I got her\ndragged back\ninto this.
But I'll be\ndamned if I\nlet it end\nthis way.
I'm winning\nthis Game.
And I'm not\nrelying on other\nPlayers doing it\nfor me.
......
Hmph.
\x22Hmph,\x22\nwhat!?
Weren't you\nlistening?
Uh-huh.\nAnd here's me\nplaying the\nworld's tiniest\nviolin.
You little...\nI just--
Did you think you\nwere special?
Every Player\nhere put up\nsomething they\nloved.
Everybody\nmakes sacrifices.
Sacrifices?\nAre you...
No.\nGotta calm\ndown.
Losing it here\nwill only make\nthings worse.
Just take a\ndeep breath\nand...
How about\nthis?
First, we\ncomplete the\nmission.
After that,\nwe can do\nwhatever you\nwant.
Oh, I suppose.
You'll just\nowe me one.
Owe you\none what!?
You're a Player!\nClearing the mission\nHELPS you!
Ugh...
Fine.
You have\nyourself a\ndeal, Neku.
So?\nWhat's the\nmission?
\x22Game II:\nAcquire the\n√3 Au pin.
\x22θ = 300 min.\nIncompletes will\nbe destroyed.\x22
Nngh...
Clock's\nticking.
So what's up\nwith this mission?\nIt's gibberish.
We know it has\nsomething to do\nwith a pin.
Any thoughts\nbeyond that,\nNeku?
Au...\nThe periodic\nsymbol for\ngold?
A pin\nmade of gold,\nmaybe?
Hmm...\nNot a bad\nhypothesis.
Let's go with\nthat for now.
What about\n√3?
√3... Well, the\nsquare root of 3\nis 1.7320508.
Some kind of\nentry code?
Ooh, a tantalizing\npossibility, Neku!\nI'm so proud.
...Bite me.
But I think it's\nreferring to a\nstreet here in\nShibuya.
A street?
The Reapers use\nnumbers to refer to\neach of Shibuya's\nstreets.
Route 1,\nRoute 2 and\nso on...
How does HE\nknow that?

And why go\nasking me--\nto make me\nlook stupid?
So let's go\ncheck out\nRoute 3.
Which is?
The road\nleading from\nCadoi City to\nMolco.
Shall we?
He knows\ntoo much.
About the\nReapers' Game,\nand about my\ndeath...
He's dangerous.
...And I know\ndangerously little\nabout him.
Right...\nI can do this.
If I'm gonna\nplay, I'm going\nfor gold!
Winning this\nslam-off is the\nonly way to get\nthe Hero Pin.
OK...\nBetter get\nto Molco.
The time's\nfinally come to\nuse my secret\nweapon!
Some kind of\ncontest at Molco\nfor [#FF0000]Tin Pin\nSlammer[#000000]?
The grand\nprize is this\n\x22Hero Pin\x22...
\x22Going for\ngold\x22?
Of course!\nThis is it!
Certainly seems\nthat way.
It's a safe\nguess that our\nmission is to\nwin that pin.
All right, then\nwe'd better get\nover to Molco.
Huff...huff...
Still alive\nover there?
Barely...\nWhat the heck\nwas that thing?
A Noise that\ntargets Reapers.
Well, duh!\nBut that's...\nIt's impossible!
Somebody must\nhave cooked\nsome up.
A fresh, steamy\nbatch of Taboo\nNoise.
What!?\nBut that's a\ncapital offense!
Do I smell\nanother game?
First one to\nfind out who's\nbehind this--
Kariya!\nThis is no time\nfor your stupid\ngames!
I'm calling\nheadquarters.
C'mon, already!\nGet a move on!
Sigh...
I don't do\nthe whole\nsweating thing,\nNeku.
Wha--
Are those\nNoise!?
Black Noise?
They look\ndifferent than\nthe usual\nriffraff.
So what's\nthe plan?
I doubt we'd\nmake it if we\ntried to run.
Then we\ntake 'em out!
What the hell\nwere those?\nI've never seen\nblack Noise.
Likewise.
Bastards were\ntough, huh?
Not only that...
We couldn't\nreally hurt them\nunless we attacked\ntogether.
Huh?\n...Really?
Wow...\nMaybe this kid\ndoes have his\nuses--
Hmm?\nDon't tell me\nyou didn't notice,\nNeku.
That doesn't\ninspire much\nconfidence, partner.\nHee hee...
--even if he\nis a snot.
In any case,
why did it\npick a fight?
Yeah...\nOur pact should\nprevent that.
How bizarre...
Huh?
The wall's\ngone...
I'm sure one\nof the other\nPlayers probably\ncleared it.
You are aware\nwe're not the\nonly ones playing,\nright, Neku?
Yes, I realized,\nthank you.
Kiss my\nass, Josh.
Sigh...
We could\nbe letting them\ndo the entire\nmission,
but nooo...
......
You done?
Bienvenido!
What are you\nsaying!?
Hmm?\nSounds like a\nscuffle inside.
You're quitting,\njust like that!?
Why go off and\nstart your own\ncompany now?
We were just\nstarting to pick\nup steam!
Sorry, boss, but\nyou can save\nyour breath.
I cracked\nthe code.
The marketing\ncode, you follow?\nI know how\nto sell.
It's all\nmarketing and\ntrends, boss.
Shibuya's one\ngiant ball of\ntrends.
Are they\ntalking business?
Ugh...
Day-in, day-out,\nwork, work, work.
They're like\nants.
Better get\nused to it.\nThat's us in a\nfew years.
Hee hee.
Not me, thanks.\nI'm going to find a\njob I can slack at\nand still get paid.
......
So this is\nTin Pin Slammer...
All I need to do\nis figure out some\nway to win this.
Good luck\nwith that.
At least\nthere's a Reaper\ndecal here.
You won't have\nany problems\nentering.
The decal\nmakes us visible,\nright?
Yup.
Every shop\nlicensed to sell to\nPlayers has one.
I'm not\ncomplaining, but...\nwhy let us shop\nat all?
The Reapers\nwant us erased,\ndon't they?
Why help\nus?
Hmm...
Does it\nreally matter?
Shopping is fun.\nThe Game's\nbetter this way.
Yeah, 'cause\nthe Game's all\nabout fun...
If you don't\nhurry, you'll miss\nregistration,\nNeku.
OK, OK,\nI'm going.
Going...to\ndo what?
I've never\nplayed Tin Pin\nSlammer in\nmy life.
I hope I'm\na natural...
That, or the\nluckiest guy on\nthe planet.
Shiki's counting\non me...
Well...\nHere goes!
So...
How do\nyou even play\nthis game?
Do you know\nhow to play\nTin Pin Slammer?
Who? Me?\nDon't be silly.
I don't\nhave a clue.\nGood thing I'm\nnot entering,\nhmm?
What!?
I thought you\nwere going to\nclear this mission,\nNeku?
......
I shouldn't\nhave bothered\nasking.
So who DO\nI ask?
Gah!
What the...
SORRY!\nI wasn't\nwatching where\nI was going!
Hmm?\nHey, you've got\nsome pins, bro!
Um, yes?
So you're entering\nthe slam-off?
That's right!\nLosing's not\nan option.
...For Neku.
But you're\ncool with\nthe idea!?
So, if you're\nnot losing, then--\nWait, you're going\nfor FIRST?
WHAAAT!?
With THOSE pins?\nAre you crazy?
Wh-what's wrong\nwith my pins?
Is this, like, your\nfirst time EVER\nor something?
Forget about\nthe slam-off, those\npins won't win you\na single round!
The kid's sure\nblunt enough.
I take it\nyou're playing\ntoday, uh...
Shuto Dan.\nCall me Shooter!
And yeah!\nI'm actually kinda\nfamous around\nhere--
the slickest\nSlammurai\n(dun dun DAAAH!)\nin town!
None of my\nbuddies can\ntouch me!
Wow, Shooter.\nYou must be a\nreal expert.
Are there\nany tips you\ncould offer?
...To Neku.
Thanks a lot,\npartner!
Come on, Neku,\nwhat do we say?
Rrgh.
...Please?
Well, you\ndo look pretty\nhopeless...
OK, bro!
Tin Pin's a\nbattle between\nSOULS!
Between...souls.
Yeah, bro!\nIt's like your fiery\npassion slams into\nthe other guy's,\nlike WHAM!
Hee hee...
Sounds like a\nfun time.
......
Think you could\nbe a little more\nspecific?
Just a sec!
I'll draw it\nout clear and\neasy for you!
Here! THIS is\nTin Pin Slammer!
......
It hurts\nto look...
My, my.
Then there's\nquite a bit of\ndepth to it.
Right!?
The timing right\nhere is super\nimportant!
This is practically\na map to victory,\nhuh, Neku?
......
Neku?\nDo you still\nnot get it?
What!?\nYou need MORE\nexplanation!?
Aww, man!\nOK, fine...
Let's SLAM!\nThat's the quickest\nway to learn!
What, right\nnow!?
Whoa!
Y-you're a\nfast learner.
So I just\nneed to knock\nthe other guy's\npins off...
All clear\nnow?
Wanna slam\nagain?
Heh heh!
You've got pretty\ngood form, bro.
So I just\nneed to knock\nthe other guy's\npins off...
All clear\nnow?
Wanna slam\nagain?
OK!\nOn your\nmark...
Get set...
SLAM!!!
NICE!!!
You picked it up\npretty good!
I kinda, sorta\nget it...
Every pin's got\nits own stats,\nso try a buncha\nstuff out!
Keep in\nmind, though,
you can\nonly play with\nthe pins you've\ngot on.
The ones\nI'm wearing?
So I can't play\nif I'm not wearing\nany pins?
NAW, BRO!\nThat's totally\ncool, too!
You can borrow\nspecial slamming\npins to play with.
You could play\nTin Pin Slammer\nNAKED, man!
Thanks, but...\nno.
WHOA!\nLook at the\ntime!
See ya!\nGood luck!
Things are\nrrreally heating\nup, folks!
It's time\nfor ourrrr\nnext battle!
In the blue\ncorner, crowned\nwith sound...
First-timer\nNeku Sakuraba!
Bring it!
In the red corner,\nthe comeback kid\ncomes back!
Slams down curry\nlike it was a pin...\nItaru Yokoyamada!
Heh heh...\nI hand-design\nand build all\nmy pin mods.
It's Yammer\nTime!
Players, on\nyour marks...
Get set...\nSLAM!!!
Yes!
WOW!!!
Your first time\nplaying, and you\n(dun dun DAAAH!)\ntotally won!
Very impressive,\nNeku.
Show those\nfifth graders\nwho's boss.
Thanks for\nkilling my high,\nman.
Too bad\nabout next round,\nthough.
Huh?
You're facing the\nTOP SEED, man.\nYou're history.
Top seed?
That means crazy\ninsane strong.
Dumb luck won't\nget you through\nthe next match.
Dumb luck?
I mean, sure,\nI'm not exactly\na pro, but...
Hmm,\nI should work\non snapping my\nstrokes...
Gotta make\nsure I--
Hee hee.
Well, I'll be\nwaiting in the\nstands, Neku.
Do your best,\npartner.
Damn right\nI will.
This is important.
What? I...\nI lost?
Heh heh!\nDid you really\nthink you\ncould win?
Look at your\npins, bro!
They're all\noff-the-shelf\nmodels!
Everyone knows\nyou should mod\nyour pins, Neku.
M-mod\nthem?
Although, if you\nget carried away...
Due to prohibited\nalterations to the\npins used in the\nlast match,
victory by\ndefault is awarded\nto the blue corner!
What!?
That's my Neku.\nYou're one\nlucky dog.
...I won.\nWhew, I'm safe.
Rrgh!\nCan't believe I'm\nout on a DQ...
Still, you're\nhistory next\nround, bro.
And why\nis that?
You're facing\nthe top seed.\nIt's over.
The top seed,\nhuh...
Dumb luck will\nonly get you\nso far.
Hey!\nI'm not exactly\na pro, but...
Hmm,\nI should work\non snapping my\nstrokes...
Gotta make\nsure I--
Hee hee.
Well, I'm headed\nback to the\nstands, Neku.
I need to\ntake care of\nsomething.
Like what?
I'll be cheering\nyou on, partner.
...Yeah.\nThanks for\nthat.
The air is\nelectric here in\nthe slam hall!
Next up, the\nmain event!
In the\nblue corner,\nNeku Sakuraba!
Who wants\nsome?
In the red\ncorner, the top\nseed and Slammurai\nlegend...
I don't care\nwho he is.\nI have to win.
Shuto Daaaan!
Him!?
HEY, MAN!\nI'm impressed you\ngot this far!
Sorry, but I\ncan't let you\nwin this one.
Because I'M\ngonna win it!
I'm up\nagainst this kid?\nUgh...
Well, if this is\nwhat it takes...
Taste the rage\nof my Red Kaiser!
Innn...\nPINCIBLE!
Gah!
It...it's over.\nI lost?
You seemed\npretty tough,\nbro!
I had to get\nserious!
And just like\nthat, the match\nis over!\nShooter does\nit again!
The top seed\nmoves on to\nthe finals!
Watch out,\nShibuya!\nWhen I'm on,
I am ON!!!
Woo!\nTime for the\nfinal match!
Better luck\nnext time, bro!
There is no\nnext time!
Shiki...\nI'm sorry, I--
Aww, what\na shame.\nNot that I'm\nshocked.
You're a\nTin Pin virgin.\nWhat could\nyou do?
Don't you see\nwhat this means!?
We failed!\nWe screwed up\nthe mission!
You sure did.\nBut relax...
Relax!?\nHow can--
Uh-oh!\nLooks like trouble\nfor our champ!
What happened?
What indeed?\nSounds like an\nupset.
Let's check\nit out.


















My pin...\nIt won't\neject!
No, Red Kaiser!\nNOOO!
It looks like a\nfreak malfunction\nhas cost the top\nseed the slam-off!
Victory goes to\ndark horse slammer\nSota Honjo!
Oh, my!\nLooks like\nShooter lost.
Huh?\nThe timer's\ngone.
Wait...\nWe cleared the\nmission?
The guy who\njust won is a\nPlayer, too.
What?
So, like, where'd\nthe timer go?
Mission\naccomplished!\nWe did it, Nao!
I thought you\nknew, Neku?
It doesn't\nmatter which\nPlayer clears\nthe mission.
So there's\nno reason for us\nto get all worked\nup over it.
Whew...\nWe're safe.
So that's, like,\nanother day\ndown?
Hope tomorrow's\nthis easy, too!
Wait up, man!
I want a...\nrematch...
Huh?\nWhere'd he go?
You can't just\nwin, then disappear!\nIt's not fair!
Let the\nother Players\ntake care of\nthe missions.
We just need\nto do what it\ntakes to stay\nalive.
...Whatever\nit takes.
And what if\nnobody clears\nthe mission?
If that kid's\ntoy hadn't broken\nwhen it did...
that would've\nbeen the end\nof us!
Hee hee...\nOh, I'm willing\nto make some\nminimal effort.
You don't\nreally think that\nwas an accident,\ndo you?
What!?
I borrowed\nyour opponents'\npins
and swapped\nin a few of my\nown.
Of course,\nmine had a few...\nadjustments\nmade.
Here, you can\nhave the originals.
Unbelievable...
You didn't\nneed to win.
Shooter just\nhad to lose.
You're...\nYou're devious!
Oh, come on.\nYou wanted to\nwin.
Wasn't that the\nwhole reason for\nparticipating?
OK, fine.\nThen why didn't\nyou tell me?
Hee hee...
Don't you\nthink it's more\nfun with a little\nsuspense?
No.
Besides,\nyou might've\nwon anyway.
I didn't want\nto hurt your\nfeelings.
You smug little...\nIs this fun\nfor you?
I'm not\nyour toy!
If you're done,\nit's my turn now.
For what!?
I've got an\nerrand to run,\nand you're\ncoming along.
I just said I'm\nnot your--
You agreed to\nthis, Neku.
After the\nmission, we do\nwhat I want.
Rrgh!
...Fine.
Good.\nThen let's head\nback to the\nscramble.
What, you're\njust going to\nignore me?
You half-blind\nhectopascals!
Hecto...\nUgh.
Nngh!\nNot again...
My head's...\npounding...
Oh, look.\nIt's a stray\nReaper.
You seem\neven grouchier\nthan usual.
Damn right!\nThat game was\nzetta dull!
Are you trying\nto bore me\nto death?
How bout\na little flair!?\nGive it some\nedge!
You brain-dead\nbinomials are\npathetic!
Wow, you sat\nthere watching the\nentire mission?
Do GMs always\nhave that much\ntime on their\nhands?
No comments\nfrom the\npeanut gallery.
Your opinions\nare garbage!
CRUNCH!
I'll add them\nto the heap!
Hee hee...\nI figured you\nweren't much\nfor criticism.
Otherwise, why\nkeep making\nthose senseless\njunk heaps?
Heh.
Every inch\nof my work\nis flawlessly\ncalculated.
Look at the\nperfectly\nunderstated\nsilhouette.
How can\nyou not see\nthe beauty!?
...Time for a\nlittle quiz.
What's the\nprobability of you\nPlayers surviving\nthe week?
Gee, I wonder.
ZERO,\nsame as your\ntaste!
Attention,\nall tasteless\ntetrahedra!
If you want to\nlive, show me the\nlimit of U as I go\nto infinity!
Not that there's\nanything any of\nyou can do.
You fractals\nhave no\nfuture!
QED.
Class is\ndismissed!
Finally...\nThe pounding's\nstopped.
What language\nis that guy\nspeaking?
Think he's got\na thing for you,\nNeku?
What!?\nHow the hell do\nyou figure that?
Oh, please!\nThe way he follows\nyou around?
That's just\nbecause I'm a\nPlayer.
I don't see him\nchasing after the\nother Players.
He's right...\nSo why me?
...Or is it\nmy fault?
What?
That's right...\nHe might be tied\nin with the\nReapers.
If he is,
that could\nexplain why the GM\nis stalking us.
...Still.
I'm just\nspeculating.
It's too soon to\nreach any definite\nconclusions.
Except...\nmaybe one.
I'd have to be\ncrazy to trust\nthis kid!
...Destroy\nthe ones you\ncalled friends.
Those are\nyour orders.
I gotta follow\norders?
Of course.
We require\nproof of your\nloyalty to the\nReapers.
Aight, yo, don't\nget your panties\nin a twist.
I'm a Reaper.\nI'll do it.
I trust that\nyou will.
I swear...
......
I'ma do this!
I didn't join up\nfor nothin'.
Where...?
The scramble\nagain?
And Joshua?
...He's on the\nphone again.
Yup...
I'll be there\ntoday.
You'll have it\nall ready for me,\nwon't you?
Who's he\ntalking to?
Same person as\nyesterday?
......
Well, shouldn't be\nlong till the mission\nshows up.
......
OK...
What's the\ndeal?
It never takes\nthis long.
Am I even getting\nreception?
Say, Neku.
...That smile\nmakes me\nnervous.
What are you\nscheming now?
Yeees?
You're coming\nwith me today,\nright?
There's\nsomeplace I'd\nlike to go.
......
You never\nfollowed through\non your promise\nyesterday.
So today,\nyou're making\nit up to me.
...Right?\nWe haven't got\nanything else to\ndo yet.
So let's go\ntake care of\nmy stuff first.
No way!\nI told you\nyesterday--
first, we do\nthe mission.\nThen you can\nplay around.
Besides, the\nmission could show\nup any sec--
Whoa, you're\nright.
There it is,\nNeku!
Let's see...
\x22Proceed to\nCat Street.
\x22Time limit:\n15 minutes.\x22
Fifteen\nminutes!?
That's on the\nother side of\nShibuya!
We'd better\nhurry, then.
No joke!\nShut up and\nstart running!
Come on!
Yes, sir!
Say, Neku.
Hate to bother\nyou when you're\nin a hurry, but--
What do you\nwant!?\nJust run!
If we're going\nto Cat Street,
it's a lot faster\nto go past the\nShibu Department\nStore.
Wha--
Why didn't you\nsay so before!?
You seemed to\nknow where you\nwere going.
I figured\nyou had some\nbrilliant plan.
Hee hee...
Like beating\nyou senseless?
Ugh, fine.\nLet's just\nhurry!
......
Ugh!\nNot one of\nTHEM?
Looks like\nthere's a wall\nup ahead.
Dammit,\nwe don't have\ntime for this!
...There's only\none way to\nCat Street.
And that's\nthrough here.
Quick, let's\nclear the wall!
Huff...huff...
Made it!
Did we clear\nthe mission!?
Huh?
No timer...
Wait!\nWas there\never a timer?
I never stopped\nto notice before...
But our phones\ngot the...
What?
There's no\nmission mail...
Whew!\nWe finally\nmade it.
It's that café\njust over there,\nNeku.
Wait...\nDon't tell me...
You lied to me!?
Kinda, yeah.
I'm surprised\nit worked\nthis well.
You... UGH!\nI can't believe\nyou!
Oh, come on.\nNo harm done.
It's not like\nwe have a real\nmission yet.
Anyway,\nhere we are--\nso let me get\nthis done.
......
Mr. H?\nYou in?
Heyyy!\nI was waiting\nfor ya, Josh.
Mr. Hanekoma!?
Hmm?\nOh, Phones!
What, you're in\nthe Game again?
Yeah...
And because\nof that, Shiki's...\nShe was my\nentry fee.
They took the\nyoung lady, huh...
Well, buck up.
Nothin' you\ncan do about\nthat right now.
'Sides, boss,\nI'm sure she\nunderstands.
...Thanks.
I see you two\nare acquainted.
Yeah.
He saved our\nasses more than\nonce last week.
What a\ncoincidence.
He's been in\nthe business of\nsaving my ass\nfor some time.
The two\nseem to go\nway back.
Is this\nwhere Joshua\nlearned all about\nthe UG?
I hate to\nseem impatient,\nbut could we,\nyou know?
Sure thing, J.\nLemme see\nyour phones.
Yours too,\nNeku.
My phone?\nWhat do you\nneed with it?
Just doing a\nlittle upgrade.
More features\nthe better, right?
Gimme just\na sec, guys.
I told him\nwe were coming,\nso it shouldn't\ntake long.
Told him how?
Wait, so the\nperson you were\ntalking to on the\nphone was--
Mr. H,\nof course.
Man, now I\nfeel like an\nidiot.
Mr. Hanekoma's\ngot his secrets,\nbut I'll trust him\nover this kid.
I guess...\nif Mr. H is OK\nwith him,
I don't have\nto worry quite\nso much.
Sorry for\nthe wait, guys.\nHere ya go.
Thanks.
Now we can\nfinally go on a\nlittle hunt.
A hunt?\nFor what?
You'll see when\nwe find it.
Let's step\nout front and\ngive the tracker\na whirl.
Hmm,\nno response\naround here.
......
Just what is\nthis tracker\ntracking?
Ready to go,\nNeku?
We'll canvass\nShibuya and look\nfor signals.
Should I\nreally go along\nwith this?
What's up,\nPhones?
You look like\nya got something\non your mind.
So this is\nyour place?
Yup!\nI call it\n\x22WildKat.\x22
Pretty hip,\nright?
Yeah...
It's a nice\nenough looking\nplace, but...
nobody's here.
How's he paying\nthe rent?
Always did\nlove me some\nbeans.
I got to be\nsuch an addict,\nI started up my\nown café.
Because\nyou love...\nbeans.
Who gets into\ncoffee because\nthey like BEANS?
That's just...\nNo.
Oh, hey!\nI said I'd fix you\nup with a cuppa\nlast time, huh?
Have one for\nthe road, man.
...Only 520 yen.
You're\nCHARGING?
So how do\nyou two know\neach other?
What, me\nand Josh?
I've known him\nfor a while now.
He'd swing\nby when he was\nbored, and we'd\ntalk.
See, he's a\nlittle special...
\x22Special\x22?
Yeah.\nHe sees things.
Things?\nLike what?
\x22I see\ndead people,\x22\nkind of sees\nthings?
Pretty much.
That's how\nhe knew about\nthe Game.
He saw the\nPlayers and Reapers\nand all when he was\nstill alive.
Oh...
And when he\nwanted to talk\nabout it, he came\nto me.
There aren't\nmany folks who'd\nlisten, if you know\nwhat I mean.
In a way,\nhe's been alone\nall his life.
He's pretty\naloof, and can\nget prickly from\ntime to time,
but he's not\na bad kid.
In any case,\nhe's your partner.\nYou're gonna have\nto make friendly.
......
The Reapers\nare supposed to\ngive out one\nmission per day,\nright?
We still\nhaven't gotten\none today.
That's what\nI hear.
The Game\nMaster's the one\nwho handles all\nthe missions,
so I can't\ntell you what\nI don't know.
But yeah,\nusually it's one\nmission per day.
The Game\nMaster...
This time, it's\nthat wack-job\njunk collector.
He's capable\nof anything...
Doesn't matter,\nthough.
I'm not letting\nthe Grim Heaper\ntrash Shiki's life.
I have to\nbeat him,\nfor her!
The missions\nare guaranteed\nto show up on\nyour phone.
When one's\nissued, you'll\nknow.
So don't go\nlosin' that phone,\nPhones.
So what's this\nphone upgrade\nyou gave us?
Oh, the tracker?
Whatever you\ncall it.
So...what, it\npicks up some\nkind of signal?
Pretty much.
I set both\nyour phones to\nlocate energy\nspikes now.
The tracker\nwill point you\ntowards the\nnearest spike.
What exactly is\nan energy spike?
You can\nask Josh what\nyou guys are\nlooking for.
......
Not if I want\na straight\nanswer.
There's one\nother feature in\nthere now, too.
Another\none?
What's it do?
I told Josh\nhow to use it.
Ask him.
......
Not if I want\na straight\nanswer.
If you're bored,\ngo take a walk\nwith Joshua.
You still don't\nhave a mission,\nright?
It'd be a\nwaste to just\nsit around all\nday.
Yeah, but...
You don't\nlook convinced.
Did you forget\nalready?
If you wanna\nsurvive in this\nShibuya, you\ngotta--
Trust my\npartner, I know.\nIt's just...
You still got a\nlong way to go,\nPhones.
Knowing it in\nyour head doesn't\nmean much if you\ndon't act on it.
......
Enjoy every\nmoment with\nall ya got.
What!?
What did you\njust say?
Huh?\nI say something\nweird?
\x22Enjoy every\nmoment with all\nyou've got.\x22
That's the motto\nof the one person\nI respect.
I've made it\nmy mantra.\nIt's the way\nI live.
You coulda\nfooled me.
Well, now's not\nreally the time to\nbe enjoying life.
Uh-huh...\nYou really have\ngot a long way\nto go.
Listen up,\nPhones!
The world ends\nwith you.
If you want\nto enjoy life,\nexpand your\nworld.
You gotta\npush your horizons\nout as far as\nthey'll go.
Are you\nkidding?
I'm stuck in\nthe Reapers'\nGame.
I can't even\nleave Shibuya.\nHow am I supposed\nto expand my\nworld?
That's for you\nto figure out.
Expand my\nworld...
Now go on!\nGit!
Found ya!
Who's there!?
Get ready to\nhurt, Phones!
You gonna\nbleed today,\nyo!
Beat...
You're OK!
Better'n OK.\nSee for\nyourself.
You've got...\nwings!
Pretty badass,\nhuh?
Proves I'm a\nReaper, yo.
A Reaper...
You really\njoined them?
Neku, you\nhave Reaper\nfriends, too?
My, my.\nYou certainly do\nget around.
He ain't\nno friend\na' mine.
I only came\nhere to erase\nyou punks.
What?\nYou don't really--
Yo, you hear\nwhat I said?
Bring it!
He's...\nstrong...
Pfft!\nThat it?
Your psychs\nis limp, yo!
I was hopin'\nfor a real fight,\nman.
But your weak\nass ain't worth\nbeatin' down.
Go on,\nget lost.
An' consider\nyourself lucky.
Hey, wait!
Ugh, talk about\nyour delinquent\nReapers.
A direct attack\non Players three\ndays in?
Such egregious\nrule-breaking!
Then he's really\nmy enemy now...
If not, he\ncould've fooled\nme.
He wasn't pulling\nany punches,\nNeku.
But why\nwould he join\nthe Reapers?
I should be\ncareful, hanging\nout with you.
If that was\na friend,
I'd hate to\nrun into one of\nyour enemies...\nBrr!
Anyway, let's\nmove on.
Ugh...\nThis sucks.
Why should we\nhave to do this?
Those two are...
Reapers!?
What's the\nGM thinkin'\nwhen he makes\nthis stuff?
I really\ndon't get\nmodern art.
Don't ask\nme, man...
Nobody can\never really tell\nwhat he's on\nabout.
Still, we gotta\nget rid of this\nheap before he\nsees us...
No joke.\nIf he sees us\nhauling his\nbaby off...
our asses\nare so grass.
Same as if\nwe ignore\nMs. Konishi's\norders.
Getting stuck\nin the middle of\nthose two bites.
......
Looks like\nthey're carting off\nthat trash heap.
At the rate\nthey're going, it'll\ntake a while.
Well, let's leave\nthem to it.
The tracker's\nresponding here,\nbut...
I don't think\nit's what we're\nlooking for.
......
Another\njunk pile...
The Grim Heaper\nstrikes again?
Know anyone\nelse who'd put\nsomething like\nthis together?
...There's\nsomething\nwritten on it.
Any tree can\ndrop an apple.\nI'll drop the\nfreaking moon.
......
Uhh...\nwhat?
I think he's\nsaying he's better\nthan gravity.
......
Uh...huh.
AAAGH!
That's Kariya six,\nUzuki zerooo.
One more!
I can still make\na comeback!
What the...
Reapers!?
Are they\nfighting?
This Tin Pin\nthing's pretty\ndeep.
...Maybe too\ndeep for you?
Shut up\nand play!
And,\nslaaam...
Tin Pin\nSlammer!?
They must\nbe bored.
Wait a...
You again?
Who plays\nthe Game\ntwice?
Anyway, I'd\nlove to erase\nyou right here,\nBUT
it's hands off\nthis time.
Hands off?
What's that\nsupposed to\nmean?
Orders, straight\nfrom the top.
Game Master\nsays nobody\ntouches the\nPlayers.
But, wait.
Why would\nhe--
I wish I knew!
...Hmm?\nUgh, phone.\nOne sec.
Yashiro\nhere.
...Hello?
I-I like...
What?\nSpeak up!\nIs this a\ncrank call?
Ugh, who in\nthe hell?
OK, that was\ncreepy...
Anyway.\nLong story\nshort,
I can't play\nwith you right\nnow...so BYE.
Why call all the\nReapers off?
What's he\nthinking?
...I don't\nget it.
Who knows?
With his ego,\nhe probably\nwants to play this\nGame solo.
Wouldn't\nsurprise me.
Anyway, the\nsignal's weaker\nhere.
Let's try\nanother spot.
......
Where'd he\ndisappear to after\nhe beat me?
I want a\nrematch...
Sucks what\nhappened\nyesterday.
I thought you\nhad it in the bag,\nShooter.
Yeah...\nThe bro in the\nheadphones\ntook off, too.
What was\nthe big rush?
Hope he\nshows up at\nStride so we\ncan play.
Hee hee...
Sounds like\nyou have a fan,\nNeku.
......
Please!
It's our hour\nof need here!
What's\nhis deal?
How many\nhours of need\ndoes this make?
You fed me\nthe same line\nlast month.
But it's\nthe truth!
A customer?
That'd be\na change.
He's back\nagain?
Sounds like\nserious business.
We should\nprobably come\nback later.
Ooh, so how\nwas yesterday?
You went to the\nslam-off, right?
Sort of...
I mean,\nwe went,\nbut...
Makoto says he's\noutgrown Tin Pin\nSlammer.
We left halfway\nthrough.
What?\nThat sucks!
He's like a\ntotally different\nperson lately.
I...I wonder if\nit's something\nI said...
It's not your\nfault, Ai!
Don't beat\nyourself up.
Thanks...
Hey!\nHow about\nsome ramen?
A new place\nopened up on\nDogenzaka!
The Prince was\nraving about it\non his blog.
C'mon, let's\ncheck it out!
OK...sure.\nThanks, Mina.
A new ramen\nplace, huh?
Mmm, ramen.
I'm a shio guy,\nmyself.\nPlain and simple.
How about\nyou, Neku?
Hmm...\nI dunno,\nshoyu?
Hmm...
Not very\nimaginative.
Well,\nexcuse me!
Eh, I'd say\nmiso.
Interesting...
......
...What!?
Yeah, probably\nshio.
My, my.\nWe're twins.
It must\nbe fate.
...Ugh.
I like\ntonkotsu.
Hmm...
Very hip.
...I guess?
Hold it!
Neku, we're\ngetting a\nresponse!
A response?
It means\nwe're close.\nIt's got to be\naround here.
Around here\nwhere?
I don't\nknow...
I need to\npinpoint this.
Let's keep\nlooking around.
Wait, Neku.\nThe signal's\ngetting weaker.
So we're going\nthe wrong way?
Let's try\nanother spot.
Hmm?
What, pick\nsomething up?
Yeah...\nThat.
What's up\nwith the line?
Let's go\ntake a look.
H-hey!\nWait up!
What are we\neven looking for?
Sigh...
Is this a\nramen shop?
Looks\npretty new.
My phone says\nthis is the place.
Here?
Hey!\nNo cutting!
Boys, boys,\nboys...
You need to wait\nin line, same as\neverybody else.
Uhh, guess\nwe're waiting\noutside, then.
That's no\ngood...
Wait...\nWe're invisible\noutside!
We CAN'T\nwait in line!
You're just\nrealizing this\nnow?
......
Ugh, and the\nline isn't getting\nany shorter.
The signal's\ndefinitely coming\nfrom in there,\nthough...
...We've been\ntracking down\nramen?
Wouldn't that\nbe a hoot?
......
Look, just\ntell me.\nWhat are we\nafter?
......
Wait!\nDo you feel\nthat!?
I don't get\nwhy that place\nis so popular.
The taste is\nnothing to write\nhome about...
Negativity.
And it's\ncoming from\nhim.
He's staring\nat the line.
You think\nsomething's up\nwith this shop?
That might\nexplain the signal\nI picked up.
Let's start\nwith the Noise\non that guy.
Hey, c'mon!\nNo butting in\nline, kid!
We're not\ngetting in any\ntime soon.
Let's try\nagain later.
Buh!\nWhat am I doing\nout here?
I can't afford\nto just sit around\ncomplaining!
I've gotta\ncome up with the\nnext big thing\nin ramen!
He went\ninside.
Let's drop\nby and talk\nto him.
It's not like\nthis line's going\nanywhere.
Yeah...
No mission\nyet, either...\nWeird.
Irasshai!
Ugh,\nwhat's that\nsmell?
I don't see\nanybody else,\nbut...
sounds like\nhe's open.
What'll you\nboys have\ntoday?
We've got a new\nlimited-time-only\nseasonal special in!\n\x22[#FF0000]The Big Catch[#000000].\x22
What the heck\nkinda name\nis that?
I'm afraid to\nask what's in it.
I'll play it\nsafe, thanks.
Just give\nme a plain old\nshoyu ra--
Exciting!\nMake mine the\nBig Catch!
No way!\nHe's either brave\nor stupid.
Him, too.
WHAT!?
You got it!\nHere ya go!
What, it's\nalready done!?
Is this...\nfood?
Mmm! ♪\nFantastic.
Ugh, he's\nEATING it!
Mister, this is\nexcellent!
Like it?
Gah ha ha!\nYa got good\ntaste, son!
What's wrong?\nEat up while it's\nhot, Neku.
...Right.
......

Huh?
It's...\nnot terrible...
It's actually\nkinda good!
Using cheese\nas a hidden flavor\nreally gives the\nsoup body.
The bold inclusion\nof a whole sea\nbream gives it flavor\nand presence,
as well as a\nsense of austere\nmajesty.
For a young kid,\nyou know your\nnoodles!
Good to see\nthere are still some\nfolks left in Shibuya\nwho get it.
I'll admit,\nit's tasty.
But...still.
Who would\norder this?
Hmm?\nClosed again\ntoday?
Another\ncustomer?
We're OPEN.
Can't you see\nthese customers?
I can't work\nwith you around.\nGo away.
Ahh, my\nmistake.
The place\nwas so empty,\nI just assumed.
So...\nGiven my offer\nany thought?
It's the guy\nwho bounced us\nfrom that other\nplace.
...Why does\nhe look so\nfamiliar?
I've got\nnothing to talk\nabout with you.\nNow get out.
Come on, champ.\nI need an answer\nsoon.
Do yourself\na favor and join\nup with us.
I guarantee you\nyour profits will\nexplode.
......
What do the\npeople of Shibuya\nwant from a bowl\nof ramen?\nIt's not flavor.
It's adventure.\nSomething\ndifferent.
Eating noodles\nin this town is\nan event...\nan experience!
That experience\nbegins the moment\nthey get in line.
What's important\nis the presentation.\nHow you sell it.
I'm sure half\nof them couldn't\ntell good ramen\nif it bit them.

Anyway, give it\nsome thought.
The offer's\nonly open for\na month.
Ha ha...
Sorry you\nboys had to\nsee that...
Are you in\nsome kind of\ntrouble?
Heh...\nMust be, if I got\nkids asking\nabout it.
So, what,\nyou wanna hear\nthe story?
Hear it and\ndo what?\nWe can't help\nhim...
......
Shh!\nWhat're you--
Let's hear\nhim out.
Sometimes all\npeople need is a\ngood listener.
We might\neven be able\nto solve his\nproblem.
If not,\ndon't worry.\nI promise I'll\nsay no.
......
You sap...
......
We can\nlisten.
But don't\nexpect any\nmiracles.
Ha ha, hey,\nthat's more\nthan enough!
Then, uh...\ngo for it.
As you can see,\nbusiness is hardly\nbooming.
If I don't\nturn out some\nserious profits\nthis month,
I'll have to\nclose up shop.
But that ramen\nwas so good!\nYou're closing?
Well, if I let\nthose guys buy\nme out, I can\nkeep going...
But you don't\nwant to?
The noodles\nthey serve aren't\nbad, but...\nthere's no love.
They treat\nramen as a way\nto make cash.
Plus they\nhook customers\nwith cheap tricks,\nnot flavor.
I say let our\nnoodles do\nthe talking!
Eeeeeek!
What the...
Ugh, the show\nbegins...
Go on out\nand see for\nyourselves.
Eeeeeek!
It's the Prince!\nHe's sooo\ndreamy!
Wait, that's...
The guy I\nmet at 104.
Mr. Spicy\nTuna Roll or\nwhatever.
He went\ninto that other\nramen place.
Let's go\nsee.
Exquisite!\nI can die in\nbliss.
F this ramen!\nF...for\nFABULOUS!
Omigosh,\nyou hear that!?\nHe F'd it!
He only F's\nthe stuff he\nreally likes!
I want to try\nwhat he got!
That's--
Eiji Oji.\nThe Prince\nof Ennui.
His blog,\n\x22F Everything,\x22\nsees 100,000\nhits a day.
...So I've\nheard.
When the Prince\nmentions a place\non his blog,
this happens.\nPeople flock\nthere.
Hmph.
Well, the\nnoodles do look\npretty good...
I'll say.
They didn't\ncut any corners\nwith the\npresentation.
Whoa, what?\nThe staff dance\nas they cook!?
I guess it's\nhalf food,\nhalf show.
This isn't a\ntheme park...
I see what\nhe meant by\n\x22adventure.\x22
The savory\nramen, the eclectic\nvenue--
I know my\nreaders will\nlove it here.
You can bet\nI'll be back\nsoon.
Always a\npleasure, sir!
This month's\nour grand opening\nspecial!
Every customer\ntakes home a \nspecial gift!
It's a doozy,\ntoo...
We're giving\nout the hottest\npin in town...\nThis!
Whoa!\nThat's, like,\nsuper-rare!
We seriously\nall get one!?
That pin...
Yeah. It's the\none we promoted\nfor a mission.
You don't\nsay...
Me and\nShiki,
we had to\nmake that pin\ncatch on.
Wait a\nminute...
That's him!\nThat guy in the\nsuit is the\npromoter guy!
Another\nfriend of yours,\nNeku?
He looks\ntotally different.\nI hardly\nrecognize him!
That's people\nfor you:\nalways quick to\ndo a 180.
Uh, 180?\nTry a 1260.
Still...\nInteresting.
OK, Neku.\nLet's go.
Huh?
Stick around,\nand we'll get\nyelled at again\nfor cutting.
...AHEM.
Right...
Out we go.
My, my,\nNeku...
I believe we\nhave an incident\non our hands.
Huh?
A new ramen\nshop explodes\nonto the\nscene--
its owner,\nan overnight\nsuccess story.
And those\nred pins...
This could be\nwhat my phone\nresponded to.
You think\nthe pins are the\nsource of the\nenergy spike?
Oh!\nAnd don't forget\nthe ramen that's\nnot selling.
Odd, don't\nyou think,\nconsidering how\ngood it is?
Hellooo?\nYou listening?
That settles it.
We'll spend\ntoday getting to\nthe bottom of\nthis mystery.
\x22We\x22?
I'm not about\nto ignore the\nmission when--
What mission,\nNeku?
......
Now, let's start\nsniffing out the\nreason this place\nis such a hit.
Hey, c'mon,\nwait your turn...
I just have\na few quick\nquestions.
Do you mind?
Wow, he\ncuts right to\nthe chase...
Huh?\nAbout what?
I'm here with a\nfriend, so keep\nit short, OK?
Why do you\nlike the ramen\nhere so much?
Why?
Uh, 'cause it's\nthe most popular\nspot in Shibuya?
She likes it\nbecause it's\npopular?
And it's fun,\ndon't you think?
Where else do\nthey dance while\nmaking your food?
And that has\nwhat to do with\nthe ramen?
Plus, they\ngave me this\ncool limited-\nedition pin.
How could\nanyone NOT like\nthis place?
But it's pretty\nnew, right?
How did it\nget this big\nthis fast?
The Prince\nwrote a post\nabout it on\nhis blog.
I mean,\nhe F'd it!
How can I\nresist food this\nfabulous?
The 5,000-yen\nprice tag is a\nlittle painful, but...
After this,\nI can tell all\nmy friends I\nate here!
Ooh, I should\nsnap a photo\nand mail them!
I see...
So how's it\ntaste? Good?
Totally!
The Prince\nsaid it was\ngreat.
For 5,000\nyen, it must be.\nJust look at\nthe photo!
It's got a\nfriggin' steak\non it...
So where else\ndo you go for\nramen?
Huh?\nFor ramen?
Umm...
I dunno,\nnoodles aren't\nreally my thing.
I barely ever\neat ramen.
Then what\nthe hell are you\ndoing here?
Ooh!\nThat said...
It'd be awesome\nto see, like, a\ndessert ramen!
Dessert...\nramen?
Yeah!\nLike, all fruity\nand sweet!
A tantalizing\npossibility.
......
Well, thanks.\nThat was\ninformative.
OK. I'm gonna\ngo eat, then.
All right.\nLet's head out.
Oh!\nPerfect timing,\nboys!
I'm trying out\na new idea.\nHave a taste!
I give you...\ndessert ramen!
Unreal...
......
Mmm♪\nVery tasty!
Yeah...\nThis is pretty\ngood!
Kudos,\nmister!
Still...\nIt's missing\nsomething.
Hrm...
Yeah...\nI thought\nso, too.
These silly\nexperiments\nwon't solve\nanything.
Maybe that\nslicked-down\nkid is right.
All people in\nShibuya care\nabout are\ntrends.
Nobody cares\nabout the taste.
Hey, now...
That's\nmessed up.
The ramen here\nis awesome, and\nnobody notices.
But people line\nup outside for\nthat other place,\nno matter how\nthe food is.
It's stupid.
Welcome\nto capitalism,\nNeku.
But why are\nthey all up on\nthat place?
They don't\neven like\nthe food.
It's a\nconversation\npiece.
People are\nalways scrounging\nfor something to\ntalk about.
\x22I came,\nI waited...\nI slurped.\x22
They're\nafter a story,\nnot a meal.
Ugh, they're\nsheep!
Maybe all of\nShibuya is.
Gah ha ha...\nWell, thanks\nanyway, boys.
But I'm not\ngiving up yet.
I'll keep making\nramen as long\nas I can.
If you come\nup with any\nbrilliant ideas,\nlet me know.
Oh!\nPerfect timing,\nboys!
I'm trying out\na new idea.\nHave a taste!
I give you...\ncurry ramen!
Unreal...
......
Mmm♪\nDee-lish!
Yeah,\nthis hits the\nspot.
Kudos,\nmister!
Still...\nIt's missing\nsomething.
Hrm...
Yeah...\nI thought\nso, too.
Hey, Yammer!\nDid you catch\nyesterday's show?
Of course!
Man,\n\x22Slammurai\x22 is\nthe BEST!
It's really\nheating up\ntowards the\nend!
I knew Dead\nwas hiding\nsomething from\nhis past.
Totally!
Why would\nBlack show\nup there...
unless he and\nYellow are actually\nbrothers! Whoa!
I can't\nWAIT for next\nweek!
Plus the movie\ncomes out next\nmonth.
I'm so psyched!
...What?
It's a kid's\nshow, Tin Pin\nSlammurai.
It's very\npopular.
Uh...huh.
The leader,\nDead, is locked in\na duel with his\nrival, Black--
at least until\nnext week.
...My partner\nwatches kiddie\nTV.
Man, I'm\nstarved...
Ooh, what\nwas that I saw\non the Prince's\nblog?
Spicy tuna rolls?
Hmm,\nwonder how\nthose are.
Someplace\naround here\nmust sell 'em.
Maybe I'll\nsneak off and\ntake a look.
Ah, yes...\nThe spicy\ntuna roll.
It's a kind of\nsushi they serve\noutside of\nJapan--
sort of like the\nCalifornia roll.
So what's\nin it?
Tuna paired\nwith a spicy sauce,\nthen rolled up.
Crazy.
Think sushi,\nwith a kick.
Is it any\ngood?
I'm a fan.
Ugh, it's\nno use.
I thought I\nhad something,\nbut...
I can't\nthink of a way\nto tie it in\nwith ramen.
Back to the\ndrawing board...
Prince, baby.\nYou're killing me.
Mick...
Gotta obey\nthat contract,\nhmm?
But--
Hey, it's\nthose two.
Sounds like\ntrouble in\nparadise.
Let's check\nit out.
Why'd you\nchange your\nblog entry?
I told you.
It's my blog.\nI write it.
I feel you,\nPrince.
I really do.
But this is\nbusiness.
Your popularity\nis the real deal.
I respect\nthat.
But the text\nyou wrote is...\nlimp.
It won't sell\nme any noodles.
We decided this\nwhen you signed\nthe contract.
I provide\nthe text.
But, Mick...
Then it's\nnot my blog\nanymore.
Plus the\nramen you serve\nthere isn't that\ngood.
When I tasted\nthe test batch it\nwas great, but...
Look, I don't\nwant to lie--
in person, or\non my blog.
I can't do that\nwhen my fans--
Eiji, Eiji, Eiji...
Babe. Prince.\nIt's fine!
None of\nthose people care\nhow it tastes!
Follow me?\nThe whole game\nis about image.
And whoever\nsells the most\nwins.
Mick...
I'll send you\nnew text and\nsome pics by\ntonight.
You'll have\nthem up on your\nblog tomorrow,\nright?
Fabulous.\nSee ya!
......
Aha.
Exactly.
Although it\nlooks like the\nPrince is tired of\nplaying puppet.
Hey!
The Noise\nhave got\nhim!
Hmm...
So they do.
This isn't right.
I can't lie to\nmy public.
I'll try talking\nto Mick one\nmore time.
I write my\nown blog.
I list my own\nthoughts,
my own\nfeelings...
The ramen\nI'd actually like\nto eat.
Sigh...\nI miss the\nold stuff.
Like the ramen\nSebastian used\nto make...
Just noodles\nand broth.
Warm, simple\nramen.
I'd kill for\na bowl of\nthat now...
Even the\nPrince of Ennui\nhas his woes.
I guess we\nall do.
Dunno why\nhe's so hung up\non ramen.
Hee hee.\nWe all have our\nhang-ups.
Ugh, I don't\nget it.
Of course\nyou don't.
What?
Everyone has\ntheir own little\ninternal world--
a secret\ngarden only they\ncan enter.
Each world\nfollows its own\ninternal logic--\nindividuality.
And the logic\nof one world\nmeans nothing\nin another.
...Understanding\nother people isn't\nhard, Neku.\nIt's impossible.
Yeah.
Even if I could,\nI wouldn't want\nto see inside\nother people.
They can\nkeep their gardens\nsecret, thanks.
Thank you all\nfor coming out\ntoday.
We appreciate\nyour patience.
As an apology\nfor keeping you\nwaiting,
help yourselves\nto one of these.
CAT-designed\nand hard to\nfind!
Today's your\nlast chance to\nget these pins\nhere, folks.
Hmm?\nMy phone's\nresponding.
To those\npins!?
Is that\nwhat you're\nhunting?
Rare pins?
Not quite.
What I'm\nlooking for isn't\na thing.
......
So...
CAT designed\nthese pins?
CAT's the big\ngraphic designer,\nright?
Yes and no.
They do\nartwork, clothes,\neven furniture.
And that's\njust the start.
Photo,\nmusic, video...\nCAT's an uber\nmulti-talent.
Shibuya's\nfull of their\nbillboard ads.
Like the one at\nTowa Records?
Yup.
CAT doesn't\njust make art.\nCAT IS art.
You're awfully\nknowledgeable.
Are you a\nfan?
Hell, yes!
CAT's all about\nenjoying every\nmoment, with all\nyou've got.
Do what you want,\nhow you want,\nwhen you want.
How cool\nis that?
Wow,\nyou sound\ndevoted.
That's why\nthis pisses\nme off.
He's using\nCAT's work to\ntrick people.
Irasshai!
Hey!\nI've been waiting\nfor you two.
Take a taste!\nSee what you\nthink!
This is...
Regular old\nramen?
Interesting...\nWell, here\ngoes.
Hold it!
Please...\nLet me try\nthat.
......
Fine...
Thank you.\nNow, to dig in...
......
Amazing!\nIs it OK for\nramen to taste\nthis good!?
F this ramen!\nF it to high\nheaven!
Uhh...
Is that a\ncompliment?
Of course!\nF for\nFABULOUS!
...Still.
This ramen is\nexceptional.
Let me guess:\na whole chicken\nin the soup?
That, and a\nhint of pork\nbone, seaweed\nand sardines...
It all blends\ntogether so\nperfectly!
Truly, the\nhandiwork of a\nramen artisan!
This is the\nramen Sebastian\nmade!
It's the same\nramen I've always\nmade.
Haven't changed\na thing.
I just serve up\nthe kind of ramen\nI'd want to eat.
Among the\nflavors, I...
I can taste\nthe love you've\nput in this.
Your love\nof ramen...\nNo.
Your love for\nramen-lovers!
Are you...\nIs that you,\nSebas--
Everybody hits\nrough patches\nin life.
So next time\nyou're down,\ndrop on by and I'll\nfix you a bowl.
Remember--\nthe future is a\nclean slate, and\nyou're the chalk!
The future's a\nclean slate...
Ha ha!\nTry a blank\nslate, pops.
Considering\nthis place is gone\nin a month.
What!?
And you...\nPrince, baby.
You're my\nwalking billboard.
Can't have you\neating at the\nother guy's joint,\ncan I?
......
I've come to a\ndecision, Mick.
I won't work\nwith you on this\nany longer.
Babe, babe...\nCalm down.
You're talking\ncrazy, Prince.
I knew after\ntasting Sebastian's\nramen again.
I refuse to be\na part of this!
Not if it\nrequires me to\nkeep lying.
And you've\ngot it backwards,\nMick.
A store isn't\ngood because\npeople talk\nabout it.
It's the product.\nThe taste!
People talk about\na store because\nit's good!
There's love\nin Sebastian's\nsoup--
love for\nthe people\neating it.
That's the sort\nof ramen I want\nother people to\nknow about!
Ugh...\nEiji.
Shibuya today\nis inundated with\n\x22adventure.\x22
And when all\nanybody offers\nis \x22something\ndifferent\x22...
you get hungry\nfor the familiar.\nIt's comforting.
Love has always\nbeen the world's\nbest secret\ningredient.
Gotta fill\nmore than just\nyour belly.
Heh...\nLove, huh?
Guess I forgot\nthat somewhere\nalong the way.
I'd harp on\nabout it left and\nright, but...
those new\nexperiments were\nall just me trying\nto get in on\nthe show.
I forgot\nthe important\npart--
the smile on a\nsatisfied customer\nwhen they're done\neating.
My job is\nmaking ramen\nthat makes\npeople happy.
Popularity is no\nreason to change\nmy soup.
I've wasted\nall this time...
But you've\nstill got your\nchalk.
Heh...\nRight.
I can cook a\nlotta ramen in\none month!
I'm stickin' to\nmy guns!
Hopefully\nthe guy's place\nwill take off.
I was thinking.\n\x22Something\ndifferent\x22...
Maybe\neveryone in\nShibuya is here\nsearching,
struggling for a\npeek into their\nneighbors' worlds.
When those\nneighbors change,\nthey get scared,
feel they\nhave to change\nthemselves--
even what\nmakes them who\nthey are.
Right.
You don't\nwant to change,\nbut you don't\nwant to be left\nbehind, either.
Of course\nnot.
We can't\ngo through life\nalone.
We're part\nof a community.\nWe have to live\nby its rules.
And the more\nwe connect with\npeople, the trickier\nthose rules get.
Yeah, and\nthe more people\nhold you back.
Screw living in\na world choked\nby rules.
I'm living free.\nLike CAT.
It's just\neasier on\nmy own.
Nobody\nelse's baggage.\nNobody else\ntying me down.
...People aren't\nmeant to figure\neach other out.
My thoughts\nexactly.
I'd rather\njust get rid\nof them.
What?
Same as you,\nNeku.
Those\nheadphones\nyou wear say\nit all.
Yeah, so what?\nI don't like\nother people.
I've got no\nuse for the\nnext world\nover...
so don't\ncome barging\nin on mine.
My own\nworld's all\nI need...
Unless...
Will you look\nat the time!
And still no\nmission...
It's probably\ntoo late now.
Our little\nhunt will have\nto continue\ntomorrow,\ntoo.
Huh?
The signal's\ndisappearing.
But before,\nit was reacting\nto these pins,\nright?
It's still\npicking mine\nup faintly.
There was a\nwhole bunch of\nthem before.
Maybe they\nadded up to a\nstrong signal?
So why\nCAT's pin,\nanyway?
It's not what\nI'm looking for.\nI know that...
OK...
Then what\nARE you\nlooking for?
Well, put\nsimply...
......
I'm looking\nfor what this\ntracker is\ntracking.
What the...\nOh, that's\nreal helpful!
What the\nhell is this\nkid after?
AHH!
The bro in the\nheadphones!
You're...\nOh, right, from\nyesterday.
Thanks for\nall your help.
Huh?
Shooter,\nyou know\nthese guys?
YEAH!\nI explained Tin\nPin to 'em!
Ouch...\nAnd they\nunderstood?
You played\nNeku in the\nfirst round,\nright?
And lost!\nRight,\nYammer?
I-I was having\nan off day!
Today's a\ndifferent\nstory!
I retooled\nmy pins and\neverything.
These new\nmods are\nunstoppable!
I smell a\nREMATCH!
Heh...\nYou think you\ncan take me?
'Cause I\ndon't think you\ncan take me.
Aww, you\nhave fans,\nNeku.
Why not\nindulge them?
......
All right!
Here I\ncome!
Aww, man...
I just modded\nmy pins, too...
Rrgh!\nBut my\npins...
That design\nshould've been\nperfect!
I tweaked\nthe heck out\nof those!
So basically,\nhe was\ncheating...
You can't\nkeep counting\non mods,\nYammer!
They only get\nyou so far!
But I...
No, you're\nright, Shooter.
Here.\nYou can have\nthis pin.
I need to\nget back to\nthe basics!
Um...OK?\nThanks.
Ugh...
Heh heh.
You can't\nbeat a Yammer\nspecial, man.
My pins\npwn.
No freaking\njoke! What was\nwith those?
Yeah, how\nmuch did you\ntweak those,\nYammer?
Wh-what?\nDon't give me\nthat look!
My mods are\nall legal!
Look, I'll give\nyou a rematch,\nOK, bro?\nAny time.
Here to play\na round with\nthe boys?
Yesss!\nI win!
This isn't\nfair, Neku.
When did\nyou suddenly\nbecome a Tin\nPin expert?
And why\nshould I answer\nthat?
How about\nbecause I'm\nasking you!?
Have you\nbeen secretly\ntraining?
Maybe.\nLook, a win's\na win.
That means\nwe wait another\nhour for the\nmission.
Ugh, Neku...\nCut me a little\nslack.
Not\nhappening.
I won.
Therefore,\nwe wait.
Ugh, fine...\nBut this is a huge\nwaste of time.
......
Hello?
This is getting\nto him.
Keep it up,\nand he's bound\nto crack.
Today fourteen\nPlayers were\nerased, sir.
Leave it to\na genius.
At this rate,\nthe Game won't\nlast the week.
About that,\nsir...
No missions\nhave been\nissued in the\nlast two days.
None?
None, sir.
Nevertheless,\nPlayers have been\ndisappearing at a\nstartling rate.
And Minamimoto?
AWOL.\nHe broke off\ncontact\nyesterday.
Our Game\nMaster's gone\nmissing?
His so-called\n\x22works of art\x22\nhave been sighted\naround the UG--
thus, I suspect\nhe is still in the\narea.
...Then let's\nleave him be\nfor now.
Meaning you won't\nrequire an inquiry\ninto Minamimoto's\nactivities?
Correct.
He's not a\nsocial animal.\nGive the man\nspace.
...Understood.
As you wish,\nMr. Kitaniji.
Any other\nproblems?
Several\nReapers were\nattacked on\nRoute 5, sir.
We suspect\nTaboo Noise.
Taboo Noise...
How does\nthis affect our\nmanpower?
The losses are\nwithin tolerances.
I've already set\nabout identifying\nand locating the\nperpetrator.
Very good.
So the Noise\nexplain the\ndwindling Player\ncount...
Yes, sir.
I'm looking into\nany correlation\nbetween the two\nincidents now.
Perfect.\nI'd expect\nno less.
I leave it\nto you,\nKonishi.
Understood,\nsir.
Sho Minamimoto...
A true genius.\nYoungest Reaper\nofficer in history.
Tactics, intel,\nwillpower,\ndecisiveness,\nperformance...
His numbers are\njust short of\nMr. Kitaniji's.
Except for\ncooperation.\nA whopping\nzero...
I'll admit he\nhas talent, but\nhis quirks are\nbeyond control.
What is he\nafter?
My analysis\nsuggests--
How can\nyou be busy,\nMr. H?
Your café is\nalways empty.
...Fine, fine.\nSorry.
...Later.
Ugh...
Fifteen\nminutes and\ncounting...
Any minute\nnow, he'll--
Say, Neku.\nCould you do\nme one teensy\nfavor?
Bingo.
Now, to\nbeat him to\nthe punch.
If this is about\nthe wait, I'm not\nlistening.
Fine.
How about a\ntrade?
Right on\ncue!
OK...\nAnswer my\nquestion, and I'll\ngo with you.
You've\ntwisted my arm.\nGo on, shoot.
...What are\nyou after?
You're\ncurious?
If you don't\nfeel like talking,\nwe can wait.
Hee hee...\nIt's nothing\nmajor.
I'm going to\njack Shibuya.
...Right.\nHow 'bout a\nreal answer?
That was a\nreal answer.
......
What?\nHow do you\njack a town?
That's why I'm\nlooking for the\nShibuya River.
What Shibuya\nRiver?
My turn\nto ask a\nquestion.
Do you really\nwant a second\nchance?
Huh?
What's\nwaiting for you\nin the RG?
You're as\nalone there\nas here.
What's the\ndifference?
......
Hee hee.\nYou don't have\nto answer.
I don't really\ncare.
Now let's\nget started.
How's our\nsignal today?
Hmm...
It's coming\nfrom out past\nShibu-Q Heads.
That puts it\nover near--
Udagawa!?
Oh, right!
You know\nthe city well,\nNeku.
Shibuya born\nand raised.
My, my!
It's coming from\nUdagawa, right?
Let's go.
Well, this is\nnew...
Someone's an\neager beaver\ntoday.
The Udagawa\ndistrict...
Same place\nI saw in your\nhead.
Along with me,\nlying dead on\nthe ground.
How'd I\ndie?
And who\nthe hell are\nyou?
I might find\nmy answers\nthere.
Hmm?
Reaper\nalert.
Let's just\nreport it to\nthe police.
Um, hello?\nWe're metal.\nAnd Reapers!
No way.\nWe'd lose all\nour cred!
Like you\nhave any\nafter boning\nthis up.
Sounds like\nan argument.
Sounds like\ntrouble we\ndon't need.
Let's ignore\nthem.
Hey!\nHold up,\nyou two.
Ugh...\nBusted.
Wait!\nYou're that--
Hey, my man!\nI remember\nyou.
Perfect timing.\nYou're not\nbusy, right?
Help a\nbrother out?
Hey, my man!\nI remember\nyou.
Wait!\nYou're that--
Perfect timing!\nYou're not\nbusy, right?
Help a\nbrother out?
You'll hear\nme out?\nRock!
Ahem.\nWe're booked.\nRight, Neku?
Sorry,\nbut we have\nsomewhere\nto be.
Right...\nUdagawa.
What?
Yo, Tenho!
On it.
What?\nA wall!?
Hey!
You wanna\nget through\nhere?
Help us\nout.
......
Thrusting your\npersonal problems\non Players?
How very\nprofessional.
Look, we just\nneed to get\nthrough here,
and we're\nkind of in a\nhurry.
Oh yeah?
Yo, Tenho!
On it.
What?\nA wall!?
Hey!
You wanna\nget through\nhere?
Help us\nout.
......
Thrusting your\npersonal problems\non Players?
How very\nprofessional.
So what's\nthe deal?
Long story\nshort?
Our band's\nmicrophone has\ngone missing!
......
Happened\naround 2:00\nyesterday.
We had a\nlittle gig at\nMolco, right?
Even unveiled\na new track.\nShoulda been\nno problem.
But!\nThe show ends,\nwe split for\nthe day--
I let our\nstuff outta my\nsight for one\nminute, tops--
I get back,\nand the mic's\ngone!
Yeah,\nsays you.
You prob'ly\njust left it\nsomeplace.
I'm tellin'\nyou, BJ, it\nwas stolen!
That thing is\nDef Märch's\nheart 'n' soul!
I wouldn't\njust lose it.
Somebody\nTOOK it!
Who the\nhell would\nwant a mic\nwith wings?
......
Wh-what!?
Hey, YOU\nlost it!
Ugh...\nFine.
Let's just\nsplit up and\nlook for it,\nOK?
Why are WE\nlooking for\nYOUR junk!?
Screw that,\nman.
You lost it.\nYou find it.
I'm outta\nhere.
Oh, Tenho...
This your\nphone, bro?
Oh, snap...
I found it\nlyin' around.
Thanks, man.\nI was wigging\nout trying to\nfind it.
Where\nwas it?
In the...\nuhh, I mean...
S-Spain Hill!
I'm headin'\nback to A-East.\nLater.
I'll go look\naround Molco\nagain...
Thanks!
I still don't\nsee how this is\nour problem...
Aww, c'mon.
Look, I'll\npay ya.
Help us\nout.
Here, lemme\npay you before\nI forget!
Ugh!\nPunk beat me\nto the draw...
No way!\nWe're--
Nngh!
Dammit...\nIt's really\nblocked.
All right.\nLet's hurry up\nand find the\nstupid mic.
Step one is\ngathering info,\nstarting with\nthe client.
Honestly, Neku.\nThis is basic\nstuff.
Yoshiya Kiryu,\nprivate dick\nextraordinaire.
Hey, boys!\nGet crackin'.
Can you give\nus a little more\nto go on?
Sure!
Whaddaya\nneed to\nknow?
Describe\nthe stolen\nmicrophone.
It's a stand mic\nwith black wings.
Black wings?
Yeah, it's\nthe band's\nsymbol.
Who'd want\na bat-mic?
I can think of\none guy...
Really!?\nWho?
Freakin' BJ.
BJ?
Guy in the\nblack hoodie?\nHe was just\nhere.
He's been\nwhining about\nwanting to do\nvocals.
We had it\nout over that\nyesterday.
Said he wanted\nhis share of the\nglory.
The mic went\nmissing right\nafter that.
Wait, he stole\nit because...
he wanted to\nbe a vocalist?\nThat makes\nno sense.
What happened\nwhen the mic\nwas taken?
I actually\ndidn't tell the\nother guys,\nbut...
just before it\ndisappeared, I\ngot a call.
A phone\ncall?
Yeah.\nThinking back\nnow, it was\npretty shady.
Why was the\ncall shady?
They didn't\ngive their\nname...
Just,\n\x22Meet me by\nCadoi City.
\x22We need\nto talk.\x22
Any\nguesses?
Not really.
Caller ID\nsaid it was a\npublic phone.
Sounded like\nan affected\nvoice, too.
So...\ndid you go?
Yeah, but\nnobody was\nthere.
When I got\nback to Molco,\nthe mic was\ngone.
That IS\nshady.
So someone\ncalled to lure\nyou away.
And you think\nthe Reaper in\nblack you were\nfighting with--
BJ, was it?\nYou suspect\nhim?
As much\nas I hate to\nconsider it...
Well, good\nluck, guys.
I'll be right\nhere.
Ugh...\nWhat a pain.
So?\nWhat now?
Well, it's\nobvious,\nisn't it?
We investigate\nthe crime scene\nand question the\npeople involved.
What, have\nyou done this\nbefore?
So we've got\nMolco and the\ntwo bandmates.
Let's get\nstarted.
Hmm?
Isn't that...
Sigh...
I thought\nfor sure it'd\nwork.
Let's see\nwhat he has\nto say.
Sigh...
AHEM.
Gah!\nWh-what!?
Weren't you\nheaded back to\nA-East?
......
...I wanted to\nlose myself\nin the crowd\nfor a bit.
Y'know?
Can't say\nthat I do,\nactually.
We just had\na few questions\nfor you.
Look, what\ndo you want?
About the\nstolen mic--
Stolen?
Please.\n777's full\nof it.
I'm sure he\njust left it\nsomeplace.
Either way,\nhe should've\nbeen watching\nour stuff.
I hear you\nwanted that mic\nfor yourself.
So what\nif I did?
Doesn't\nmatter now.
I don't need\nit anyway.
Where were\nyou yesterday\nat 2:00?
Oh, uh...\nI was...
You know,\nuhh...
Dogenzaka!\nYeah!
In line\nfor the new\nramen place!
Why would\nI go to the\nphone booth\nby Molco?
I don't\neven know\nit's there!
Not the\nsubtlest guy,\nis he?
Mm-hmm...
Wh-what?
Just gimme\nsome space,\nwould ya?
I want to\nspend some\ntime alone.
Hee hee.\nSomehow,\nI doubt his\nstory.
Yeah...\nHe's hiding\nsomething.
Still--
It'll take\nhard evidence\nto get him to\nfess up.
...So let's go\nfind some.
Where were\nyou yesterday\nat 2:00?
Oh, uh...\nI was...
You know,\nuhh...
Dogenzaka!\nYeah!
In line\nfor the new\nramen place!
Why would\nI go to the\nphone booth\nby Molco?
I don't\neven know\nit's there!
Mm-hmm...
Wh-what?
Just gimme\nsome space,\nwould ya?
Of course.\nBut first...
take a look\nat this photo.
Wha--
How did--
That's the\nphone booth\nnear Molco.
Aka the phone\nbooth of love.\n...Right?
Gah!
Isn't there\nsome kind of\nurban legend?
They say if\nyou use this\nphone to confess\nyour love,
the other\nperson will love\nyou back.
Oh, um...\nreally!?
I don't\nknow who\nyou called.
But you were\nthere yesterday.\nThat much is\nfact.
But I--
You weren't\nin Dogenzaka.
You were\nchatting up\nsome tramp\nnear Molco.
She's NOT\na tramp!
Damn, Josh...\nRemind me not\nto tick you off.
You can't\ntell ANYONE\nabout this!
OK, so I\nwas there\nyesterday!
I made a call!\nAre you\nhappy now!?
Quite.\nYou've been\nvery helpful,\nthanks.
Ugh...\nI'm headin'\nback to see\n777.
Hopefully\nhe's found the\nstupid mic\nby now.
Seriously,\nif you tell a soul,\nyou're dead.
I don't think\nwe're getting\nanything else\nout of him.
Let's\nmove on.
Hmm?
Isn't that...
......
Let's see\nwhat he has\nto say.
Any luck\nfinding the\nmic?
......
I'd like to\nask you a few\nquestions.
...Sure,\nwhatever.
777 said the\nmic was the\nband's soul.
What makes\nit so special?
It just is.
Back when we\nwere still busking\non the streets,
we all pooled\nour money to\nbuy it.
It's a symbol\nof our bond\nas a band.\nAs friends.
I stuck wings\non it, to remind\nus of that.
Got us\nthrough some\nrough times.
I see...
But lately 777\nand BJ have been\nfighting over who\ngets to sing--
over who\nhas rights\nto the mic.
Talk about\nirony...
You must be\nhappy, then--
the object\ndividing them\nis out of the\npicture.
Yeah...
...B-but not\nthat happy!\nI just...
Hmph.\nNever mind.
Where were\nyou yesterday\nat 2:00?
...R-right\nhere?
Are you\nasking us or\ntelling us?
Ah, yes.\nBJ said he found\nyour phone on\nSpain Hill.
Yeah... Must've\ndropped it here.
Well, I don't\nsee our mic\nhere.
I'm going\nback to wait\nwith 777.
You've been\nvery helpful.
He said\nthe mic went\nmissing at\nMolco, right?
Look.\nA phone booth.
Oh, right.\n777 said the\ncall came from\na pay phone.
Then let's--
Hey\nthere!
Aren't you,\nlike, Players?
And you\ntwo are...
Ahh, yes!\nThe winners of\nthe slam-off.
You, like,\nremember us?
Super yay!
You need\nsomething?
So, like, I'm\nalways with the\nsame guy,
and I wanted\nto talk to\nsomebody else\nfor a change?
And most\nfolks can't, like,\nsee us, so...
What're your\nnames?
I'm Joshua.\nThis is Neku.
Nice meetin' ya,\nNeku, J-dawg.
I'm Sota.
The cute\none's Nao.
Call me\nNao-Nao for\nshort, 'K?
Uhh...\nsure.
Hey, did you\nguys know?
No missions\nyesterday or\ntoday,
but Players\nare still gettin'\nwiped out.
Wiped out?
You should\nbe careful,\nNekky!
N-Nekky?
We saw some\nreal scary\nNoise before?
We ran like\nbunnies!
You should, like,\ntotally run if you\nsee 'em!
Let's just all\nstay sharp and\nget through this\ntogether, huh?
Uh, yeah.
Hmm?\nDidn't you\nknow?
Hey, man,\ndon't--
Even if\nmultiple Players\nsurvive...
only so many\nget to come\nback to life.
What?
Um, like,\nuncool?
The other\nPlayers aren't\nyour friends.
They're your\ncompetition.
That goes for\npartners, too.
No way...
If, like, two\npeople survive?
And only\none gets to\ngo back?
What\nhappens to the\nother one?
They play\nagain, same as\nNekky here.
......
Whoa, like,\nthis is your\nsecond time!?
...Yeah.
Then your\npartner made\nit back!
No...\nshe didn't.
Huh? I don't\nget it.
She was\ntaken as my\nentry fee.
No way!\nThat's, like,\nsuper cruel!
I chose to\nplay again,\nand she...
It's my fault\nshe didn't\nmake it ba--
No worries,\nman.
Huh?
She was\nyour entry\nfee, yeah?
That means\nyou really care\nabout her.
No reason\nto feel guilty\nfor that.
Yeah!\nIt's, like, totally\nnot your fault?
I'd gladly be\nSota's entry fee\nif it gave him\nanother chance.
And I'd play\nthe Game a\nmillion times\nfor Nao.
Whatever it\ntakes to get us\nboth back to\nthe RG, dawg.
......
You don't\nthink I'm to\nblame?
Forget blame,\nman!
Plus, I don't\ncare if only one\nof us gets a\nsecond chance.
I still ain't\nsniping other\nPlayers.
Yeah!\nLike, fighting\nso isn't the\nanswer?
We all want to\nbe alive again.\nNobody \x22deserves\x22\nit most, right?
...I want\nyou to win,\ntoo, Nekky.
So, like,\nthis is for\nyou?
A pin?
Yeah!\nWe, like, won\nit at the\nslam-off?
And now\nit's yours.\nYay!
You sure?
We couldn't\nuse it.
Not that\nwe're dumping\nour trash on\nyou, but...
Anyway,\ngive it a try.
Thanks.
We should\nprolly move\non, yeah?
Be safe,\nNekky! Bye,\nJosh-Josh!
Like, see\nyou later?
They were\ncharming.
Nobody deserves\nit most...
Hmm?
It's true...\nEverybody's got\ntheir own deal.
Their own\ndreams.
None of them\noutweighs the\nnext...
Shibuya's full\nof all kinds of\nfolks, huh?
Hee hee...\nTalk about your\nnon sequiturs.
Sorry...
...So how 'bout\nwe check out\nthat phone?
\x22Feeling pinned?
\x22Break down\nthose boundaries.\nRED SKULL.\x22
Hey, it's that\ncommercial...
Ooh! Ooh!\nLook, it's playing!
That CAT\npin is phat!
You can't\nfind that pin\nanywhere!
It's really\ntaken off...
Even folks who\nseem like they\nwouldn't be into CAT\nhave 'em on.
Bet they\ndon't appreciate\nit at all.
Like the guy\nhanding them\nout at the\nramen place.
Looks like\neverybody has\nRed Skull\nfever.
Shiki and I\nwere pretty\nthorough.
Looks an\nawful lot like\nthe Player Pin,\nhmm?
......
So who makes\nthe Player Pins,\nanyway?
The Reapers?
Nope.
That's Composer\nterritory.
He's responsible\nfor creating and\ncontrolling them.
The Composer...
The guy\nin charge of\nShibuya?
Correct.
We're in the\nComposer's\nGame.
The Reapers\nare just his\nenforcers.
They\nexecute his\ndesigns.
Some\ndesigner.
His Game\nroyally sucks.
Hee hee...\nDoesn't it?
......
Can he and\nhis Reapers go\nto the RG?
RG, UG--\nit's all the same\nShibuya.
Just, people\nin the RG can't\nsee us here.
We're like\nair, Neku.\nInvisible, but\nvery real.
Players are\nonly visible in\nshops with\nspecial decals,
but Reapers\ncan materialize\nat will.
They're perfectly\nvisible in the RG--
minus the\nwings, of\ncourse.
So they\nhave wings\nhere,
but not\nin the RG?
Apparently\na Reaper's\nwings house\nhis power.
So they're\nbasically just\nnormal people\nin the RG...
......
So the Player\nPins only exist\nin the UG.
The Composer\nmakes them.
And now the\nRed Skull pin...
with a very\nsimilar design.
Hell, it's\nfreaking\nidentical.
Coincidence?\nNot likely.
So, what?
Are they\nboth just...\nNo.
They're made\nby the same\nperson?
Then...that\nwould make the\nComposer...
No way.\nNot CAT!?
Hmm?\nSomething wrong,\nNeku?
No.\nI'm fine.
Hmm, no\nmicrophones\nhere...
Thank you,\nCaptain Obvious.
777 said the\ncall came from\na pay phone.
Is this\nthe one?
This looks\nlike a job for\nmy phone!
...Huh?
What, the\ntracker?
No, the\nother new\nfeature.
What other\nnew feature?
The camera.
Don't most\nphones already\nhave a camera?
Hee hee...\nWatch and\nlearn.
I simply set\nthe time to\nyesterday,\nand...
Watch and\nlearn what?\nIt's a photo.
Hmm...
Let's try\na different\ntime.
Ahh!\nThe mic!
So it was right\nhere at this time\nyesterday.
What the\nheck?
How did\nyour phone--
Weren't you\nlistening to\nMr. H?
He added a\ncouple of new\nfeatures.
One's the\ntracker.
The other\none's this\ncamera.
It takes\nphotos of\nthe past.
Holy...
That's Mr. H's\nwork? Who the\nhell IS he?
So, could you\nshift the time\nlater to see who\ntook it?
Let's try.
That's...\nBJ, right?
And the\nmic's gone!
Hmm, very\nsuspicious.
Let's take\none more,\njust to be--
Can't.
Huh?
There's a\nthree-shot-per-\nday limit.
What?\nWhy!?
How should\nI know!?\nAsk Mr. H!
Suddenly,\nit's a lot less\nimpressive...
Then we'll\nuse mine.
...Huh?
Something\nwrong?
My phone\nhas no\ncamera.
Hmm...\nHe must have\nforgotten to\ndo yours.
......
Care to see\nthose shots\nagain?
It's empty.
So the\nmic wasn't\nthere yet.
That's their\nmicrophone.
Huh?
What's that\nblack thing on\nthe phone?
Looks like\na cell.
Why bother\nwith a pay\nphone if you've\ngot a cell?
That's BJ,\nright?
It would\nseem so.
What was he\ndoing here?
He may\ntell us if we\nshow him this\npicture.
Well?\nAny luck?
Not yet...
Ugh...\nGuess it's time\nto call the cops.
Some Reaper\nyou are...
Well, if we\nhaven't found\nit by now...
it's probably\nnot turning up.
I'll go report\nit to the po'.
Not so\nfast...
Huh?
I think I've\nidentified\nyour thief.
You\nserious!?
Wait,\nwhat?
Hee hee.
Let's recap,\nhmm?
The theft\noccurred\nyesterday\nat 2:00.
777 received\na strange\nphone call.
What phone\ncall?
\x22Meet me by\nCadoi City.
\x22We need\nto talk.\x22
The microphone\nwas stolen while\nhe was away.
......
According to\n777's caller ID,
the call\noriginated at a\npublic phone.
Care to know\nwho placed it?
We have\nconclusive\nproof.
What!?
Y-you guys\naren't gonna--
This photo\nshows...
Neku?
What, I'M\ntelling them!?
Uhh, this\nphoto tells\nit all...
......
There's\nnothing\nthere.
Huh?
Neku...
Wrong photo.
You jerkin'\nus around?
Proof my\nass...
Really, Neku.\nStop fooling\naround.
Hrm...

That's our\nmic!
It was in the\nphone booth\nby Molco?
But I looked\nthere...

That photo\ndoesn't show\nanybody!
Ahem...\nNeku?
Wrong photo.
Proof my\nass...
Really, Neku.\nStop fooling\naround.
Hrm...

Wait...
BJ!?
I told you\nnot to say\nanything!
So it WAS\nyou who\ncalled me!
Whoa there.
When did you\nget that call?
Precisely,\nthat is.
Uhh, lemme\ncheck...
1:40.
Take a closer\nlook at the\nphoto.
See?\nIt was taken\nat 2:02.
BJ used\nthe phone.\nThat much\nis fact.
But he wasn't\ncalling you.
......
No, he was\ncalling a lady\nfriend, hmm?
To whisper\nsweet nothings\nin her--
AHHHHH!
......
OK! OK!\nI admit--
I told a\nchick I like\nher!
And she\ncompletely\nblew me off!\nHappy now!?
Go ahead!\nLaugh!
......
Deep breath,\nBeej.
That isn't\nthe point of\nthe photo.
Look what's\nin BJ's left\nhand.
Hmm?\nIs that a\ncell phone?
Certainly\nlooks like it.
But not\nBJ's.
I don't\nget it...
Look at\nthis photo.
Would you\ndo the honors,\nNeku?
......
Neku, Neku,\nNeku...
The OTHER\nphoto.
......
The one of\nthe mic?
What\nabout it?
Ignore the\nmicrophone.
Look on\ntop of the\ntelephone.
It's that\ncell phone!
Correct.\nIt was there\nwhen BJ\narrived.
He saw it,\nand took it.
Now, why\nwould he do\nthat?
Cause it\nbelonged\nto...
Waaait\na minute!
You knew\nthe owner.
So you picked\nit up and\nreturned it.
Oh, Tenho...
This your\nphone, bro?
Oh, snap...
I found it\nlyin' around.
Thanks, man.\nI was wigging\nout trying to\nfind it.
Where\nwas it?
In the...\nuhh, I mean...
S-Spain Hill!
Tenho!?\nBut...but...

BJ said he\nfound the cell\non Spain...
Ohhhhhh.
BJ didn't want\nanyone finding\nout he got\nblown off.
So he lied\nabout where\nhe found it.
...Well?
I'd say this\nmakes for an\nairtight case.

Tenho left\nhis cell in the\nphone booth.
The question\nis...why.
......
I'm sorry,\nguys.
It was\nall me.
What?\nWhy, man!?
I thought\nit'd stop you\ntwo fighting.
I don't\nwant us to\nbreak up...
So...\nI just...
......
Sorry, bro.
We put you\nthrough a lot,\nhuh?
Yeah, my\nbad, Tenho.
I was outta\nline about\nwantin' to\ndo vocals...
......
But that's\nall over now,\nright!?
We good\nagain?
Heh, I'm\ncool.
Good.\nNow let's have\nthat mic,\nTenho...
It, uhh...
It kinda got\nstolen.
WHAT!?
I called\n777 from that\nphone booth.
Once he\nleft, I grabbed\nthe mic.
I was on\nmy way to\ngo hide it...
but 777,\nI saw you\ncoming back.
I freaked\nand hid in the\nphone booth.
I was just\ngonna wait\nit out.
Then you\ncalled me.
\x22The mic's\nbeen stolen!\nCome meet me\nby Molco!\x22
So, I stashed\nthe mic in the\nphone booth.
I musta\nleft my phone\nin there, too.
I checked in\nwith you,\nbut when I\nwent back...
The mic\nwas gone!
Gone?
Yeah.
This was in\nthere in its\nplace...
A megaphone?
With some\nfreaky stuff\nrecorded\nin it...
SINE!
COSINE!
TANGENT!
......
I'm sorry,\nguys!
I just wanted\nus to stay\ntogether!
Now, because\nof me...
That megaphone\ncould only belong\nto one person.
Hee hee...\nFascinating.
It seems\nthis mystery\nruns deeper!
Care to\nenlighten them,\nNeku?
Tell them\nwho really took\ntheir mic.
No brainer.
The guy\nwho took the\nmic is...
Hee hee.
You can\ntell them the\ntruth, Neku.
Now let's\nhave it.
The true\nthief!
None of\nthese guys.
1:40 p.m.
Meet me by\nCadoi City.\nWe need to\ntalk.
...Huh?\nHey!
Who are\nyou?
Now's my\nchance!
1:50 p.m.
Oh, crap!\n777!
Gah!\nGotta hide!
......
Whew...
Hmm?\nMy phone?
Hello?\nIt's me!\n777!
We're boned!\nThe mic's been\nganked, bro!
Hurry on\nback to\nMolco!
Ugh...
Be right\nback, mic.\nStay put.
1:57 p.m.
Hmm?\nWhy, hello!
This mic is\nzetta sexy!
Perfect for\nmy opus!
...Here.\nWe'll call\nit a trade.
2:00 p.m.
OK. OK.\nLet's do\nthis.
I'm gonna\ntell her.
I'm gonna...\nHuh?
That's Tenho's\ncell.
What an\nairhead...\nAh, well.
...Sniff.\nPhone booth\nof love my\nass!
2:10 p.m.
Now, to\npick up\nthe--
Gah!\nIt's gone!?
...The hell is\nthis megaphone?
Great story.\nNow where's\nour mic?
Hmm...
Knowing\nhim?
In that\njunk heap\nover there.
What!?
Our baby is\nin that pile\nof trash!?
Start digging,\nboys!
......
Sorry to\ndrag you guys\ninto this.
I cleared\nthe wall.
Go on.\nWe'll manage\nfrom here.
Best of\nluck.
Now then!\nShall we head\nto Udagawa,\nNeku?
That was\nthe detour\nfrom hell...
Look who.
We've been\nlooking forever,\nand still nothing!
Chill out,\nUzuki.
Slow and\nsteady, girl.
Are you\nkidding!?
This is a\ndirect order from\nMs. Konishi!
Don't you\nblow my big\nchance to--
Ugh, you\nagain?
You actually\nlook busy\ntoday.
Very busy,\nthank you.
We certainly\ndon't have any\ntime to waste\non you.
Kariya, we're\nleaving!
Aight.\nWhatever...
Hmm, wonder\nwhat they were\nlooking for.
The signal's\ngetting weak.
Let's try\nsomeplace\nelse.
......
Hey,\nMr. H!
Yo!\nWhat's up?
You forgot\nNeku's phone\ncamera.
Honestly,\nMr. H...
Oops!\nMy bad.
Can you\nadd it now?
I'm actually\nfresh outta\nparts...
Sigh...
Guess it'll\nhave to wait,\nthen.
Next time!\nI promise.
Let's just\ngo, Neku.
Another\njunk pile...
The Grim Heaper\nstrikes again?
Know anyone\nelse who'd put\nsomething like\nthis together?
...There's\nsomething\nwritten on it.
Any sound can\nshake the air.\nMy voice shakes\nthe heart!
......
Uhh...\nwhat?
First of all,\nsounds don't\nreally shake\nanything...
I think he's\nsaying he's better\nthan air.
......
Uh...huh.
Hmm...
Never dreamed\nthese pins'd get\nso big...
I am GOOD at\nthis stuff!
So that's\nthe guy?
The one who\ngave that\npromoter guy\nthe pin job?
...Not that\neither one of\nthem did any\nof the work.
Gotchu\npunks.
Hope you\nbrought your\nA-game\ntoday, yo.
Beat...
Don't do\nthis.
I don't want\nto fight you.
Beggin' won't\nwork, yo!
Look, I\nhave to win!\nFor Shiki, too!
So would\nyou please\ngo away!?
Shut it!
Le's jus'\ndo this!
Nngh...
That's about\nall I've got...
Yo yo yo,\nyou even\ntryin'?
Hit harder!
I barely\nfelt that!
Man, y'all\nare stale.
Next time\nat leas' put\nup a fight.
Whew...
That was\npretty close.
......
He's serious.
He must really\nnot like you.
I could see\nhim hating me.
...But why\nerase Shiki,\ntoo?
Is he really\nall Reaper\nnow?
Hmm?\nWhat's this,\nNeku?
A pendant?
This was\nRhyme's.
Beat must've\ndropped it.
I guess so.
He's no\ngenius,
but he must've\nhad a reason\nto join them.
This meant a\nlot to him...
I should\nreturn it.
Hold it, Neku!\nI'm getting a\nresponse!
Where now?
Know Udagawa\nwell, Neku?
Yeah. I used to\ncome here after\nschool.
With your\nfriends?
Please.
I don't do\ngroups.
I never met\nanyone fun to\nbe around.
Hee hee.\nMe neither.
We seem to\nhave a lot in\ncommon.
You know,\nNeku...
Shibuya's a\nlot like you.\nCut off.
Where did\nthat come\nfrom!?
The UG is split\ninto different\nareas.
Shibuya's just\none of them,
just like it's only\none part of the\nworld at large.
Each UG area\nhas unique rules.\nYou can't travel\nbetween them.
Mr. H told\nyou all that?
...Oh, so you\nknow about our\nconversations.
......
As I was\nsaying,
every area\nhas its own\nrules.
They never\nmeddle with\neach other.
Sound\nfamiliar?
That could\napply to\nanyone.
Hee hee...\nMaybe so.
As long as\nwe all have our\nown worlds,
people will never\nreally understand\neach other.
Right?
They're them,\nand I'm me.
Talking to them\ngets me nothing.
I thought I'd\nnever respect\nanyone,
until I saw\nCAT's mural
and discovered a\nnew philosophy.
\x22Do what\nyou want,
\x22how you want,\nwhen you want,\x22\nwas it?
Yeah.\nIt blew me\naway.
CAT was living\nthe life I always\nwanted to,
but never\nthought I\ncould.
\x22Finally,\nsomeone who\ngets me,\x22\nI thought.
Enjoying\nthe moment's\nabout freedom.
I just need\nto do my own\nthing like CAT.
Forget about\nother people\nand just enjoy\nmy life...
Absolutely.
Who needs\nother people's\nvalues?
It's easier to\njust live by your\nown rules.
Yeah...
But...
I don't feel\nthat way\nanymore.
Since coming\nto the UG,\nreading people's\nminds--
Shibuya's full\nof people with\njust as many\nviewpoints.
Mr. H said\nthe world ends\nwith me.
To expand my\nworld, I have\nto learn to look\nfarther--
not write off\nother people's\nvalues as\ninferior.
...Maybe I had\nit backwards.
Maybe I need\nto open up to\nreally enjoy--
Yoo-hoo?\nNeku?
......
Well, we may\nbe stuck in\nShibuya.
But you can\nstill see a\nfair ways.
Why do you\nsuppose that\nis, Neku?
Why show us\nwhat we can\nnever reach?
......
Hee hee.
That mural\nyou mentioned\nis up ahead,\nright?
The signal's\ncoming from\nthat direction.
Let's take\na look.
3 is the point\nof the 1.
4 the 1-5-9\nare 2.
Hey, it's...
Shh!
Let's see\nwhat he's\nup to.
6-5, 3-5!\n8-9, 7-9!
32384\n62643\n38327!
And...\nperfect.
Soon...\nSoon I'll have\nmy desired\nsolution.
What was all\nthat about?
This is...
Vandalism?
He drew it\njust now,\nright?
More of his\nloony art?
I wonder...
My phone's\nresponding\nto it.
To these\nscribbles?
I thought you\nwere looking for\nthe Shibuya River.
I am.
Uhh...\nI don't see\nany rivers.
Thank you,\nNeku.
...What IS\nthis?
Considering\nthe artist,
it can't\nbe anything\ngood.
Well?\nShould we\nerase it?
He'll know.
Besides,\nit could be\na trap.
Let's leave\nit for now.
......
Now's the\nbest time.
If I take\nhim to where\nI was lying on\nthe ground...
Hey--
Say, Neku?
Wh-what?
I'd like to\ncheck over by\nthat mural.
Do you\nmind?
Uh...\nsure.
The weasel\nbeat me to\nit...
What's he\nneed over\nthere?
Ugh, finally!
Deep breath,\ngirl.
Don't give\nme that!
Why'd those\ntwo brats have\nto show up?
They're so\nin the way!
Why can't\nMath Man just\nlet me erase\nthem!?
Whew...\nAnyway.
What the heck\nwas the GM\ndoing here?
Other than\nthinking up\nmissions not\nto give.
Uzuki...\nGet on the\nhorn with HQ.\nNow.
What?\nWhy?
That's a\nTaboo Noise\nrefinery sigil.
That!?
I never knew\nwhat they\nlooked like...
So the GM's\ngone maverick!?
This is the\nsource of the\nTaboo Noise?
Not quite.
This sigil\nstill hasn't\nbeen used.
There must\nbe another\nsource.
Still, we saw\nhim draw it.
That's pretty\nstrong evidence\nhe's behind it all.
...Do you smell\nthat, Kariya?
Promotions!\nGlory!
I'll pass.\nInstead of buyin'\nme that bowl\nof ramen,
you can just\ntake care of\nthe report for\nme, aight?
What, you're\ntoo lazy to\neven claim\nthe credit?
Something\nlike that.
'Sides...
I may have\nanother mystery\nto unravel.
Impressive\ngraffiti.
It's CAT's.\nThis is my\nfavorite spot.
And the spot\nwhere I died in\nyour head.
...Wait.
I assumed I was\nlooking at your\nmemories... 
But couldn't it\njust have easily\nbeen your\nimagination?
What I saw\ndoesn't prove\nanything.
You could've\nhad nothing\nto do with--
Still with me,\nNeku?
Huh?
You spaced\nout.
Oh...\nSorry.
You're giving\nme déjà vu.
What!?
Déjà vu?
From when?
Did...
did you\nreally see\nme die!?
Were those\nscans really\nof...
Was that my\ndeath!?
......
I have to\nknow for\nsure.
...One more\nscan.
I have to\nknow for\nsure.
...One more\nscan.
I...\nIt was here.
Something\nwrong, Neku?
He...
He killed\nme!
Hello?
...I'm here.
Just a\nlittle dizzy.\nI'm fine.
Good.\nLet's move\non.
Nothing else\nto see here.
Ugh, this\ntracker's\nleading us in\ncircles...
Did Mr. H give\nme a dud?
How can he\nact so normal\naround a guy\nhe killed?
He sought\nme out as\na partner!
...Hell, why\nkill me at all?\nWhat did I do?
Did he know\nme when I\nwas alive?
I didn't\nknow him.
Random\nhomicidal\nimpulse?
Ugh, he must\nhave had a\nmotive...
Too many\nquestions!
One thing's\nfor sure,\nthough...
I'm partnered\nto my killer.
HEY, BRO!
You slammin'?
Here to play\na round with\nShooter?
AWRIGHT!\nLet's do this!
Aww,\nbut bro...
WOW, bro!\nYou're getting\ngood!
I can't\nbelieve you\nbeat Shooter!
I let him\nwin.
I thought it'd\nbe mean to\ncrush him!
You little...
Still, bro,\nthat was NICE!\nTake this.
Heh!\nYou've got a\nways to go.
Rrgh...
I'm up for\na rematch!
Any time\nyou want!
HEY, BRO!
You slammin'?
Here to play\na round with\nShooter?
Hello?\nYeah, Mr. H?\nIt's me.
You gave me a\nbum tracker!
He killed\nme...
Why?
What would\nhe stand to\ngain?
Fastest way\nis just to ask.
...Ugh, no.
I still don't\nhave enough\nproof.
And besides...
Three days...
Three more\ndays, and it's\nall over.
There's no\nmission today\neither.
Yeah, we can\nget there.
Something\nelse is bothering\nme, too.
Three more\ndays with him.
He's a loose\ncannon.
I need to\nwatch my\nback.
You better!
OK, thanks.\nLater.
This is\nfor Shiki.
I can last\na few more\ndays.
All set?
First, I have\na question.
Oh? What is it\ntoday, Neku?
What are\nyou after?
This again?\nI told you.
I'm [#FF0000]jacking\nShibuya[#000000].
But what\ndoes that\nmean?
You're looking\nfor some river.\nThen what?
Tell me now,\nor you're on\nyour own.
......
Sigh...\nFine.
I'll keep\nthis simple.
Remember\nwho's in charge\nof Shibuya?
The Composer.
Very good.\nRight now HE'S got\nShibuya jacked.\nUnder his control.
I want to\nchange that.
Change it?
...Wait.
You want to\nbust in on the\nComposer with\nguns blazing?
Eventually.
I have\nto find him\nfirst.
He should be\nat the Shibuya\nRiver.
Hence our\nsearch.
Satisfied?
So it's the\nComposer...
We've been\nrunning around\nShibuya looking\nfor him?
With a busted\ntracker, yes.
Wait, so the\nGrim Heaper's\nbeen after...
Me, most\nlikely.
I guess he's\nonto me.
Ugh, just\nwhat I need.
I'm in this\nto win!
I can't afford\nany unnecessary\nrisks!
Neither\ncan I.
Then why\nare you...
Ugh, this kid\nis the devil!
Ready to\ngo to\nMr. H's?
What for?
To get him to\nfix this glitchy\ntracker.
You're still\ngoing after the\nComposer?
Of course.
Now come on.\nYou've asked\nyour question.
......
So, Kariya.
What's this\nbig mystery\nyou mentioned\nyesterday?
Oh, just\nPhones and the\npetit prince.
Those two?
What\nabout 'em?
We're\nabout to go\nfind out.
Wait, find\nout how?
It's hands off\nthe Players.
GM's orders,\nremember?
So I'll use\nmy head.
Besides, we're\njust going to play\na little game.
......
And that's\ndifferent how?
Details.
Well,\nI'm stinkin'\nbored.
Count\nme in!
Whoa there.
Huh?
Hey, kids.\nHow goes?
You're...
What do\nyou want?

You up for a\nlittle game?
Excuse\nme?
Look, we're\nbusy here.
Zing!\nWhere's the\nlove?
Yo, Uzuki.
On it!
Huh?
Wall's up!
Sowwy.
Hey!
Now then...
Game on?\nI think so!
Rrgh...
Great.
And you're\ndone.
Thanks for\nplayin'.
......
Later!
......
What was\nthat about?
Who knows.
What a waste\nof time.
...Well?
Figure\nanything out?
Maybe.
Can you be\na little more\nspecific?
Ugh, sorry...
Yashiro\nhere.
......
Taboo Noise?\n...All right.
Understood.
I'll take\ncare of it.
Hmm?
Another Taboo\nNoise sighting.
Lovely.
Where at?
HQ lost sight\nof 'em on\nDogenzaka.
Well?\nLet's go!
Go where?
What do you\nmean, where?\nAfter them!
You said\nHQ lost sight\nof 'em.
Are we\nsupposed to\nwander around\nall day?
Got a\nbetter plan?
Let those\nkids be the\nbait.
Then we just\ntag along until\nthe Taboo\nNoise bite.
Might even\nlearn a thing\nor two about\nthe bait.
Ugh...
And here\nI got my\nhopes up!
THIS was\nyour game?
Booo-ring!
So, spit\nit out.
What's\nso interesting\nabout that kid\non his second\nround?
Wrong kid.
What, you're\neyeing the\nsnobby one?
What about\nhim?
Oh, you'll\nsee...
Oh, hey\nguys.
Let's see\nthat phone.
Thanks.
It's been\nresponding\nto most of\nShibuya.
I'll have it\nfixed in a jiffy.\nSit tight.
Ah! Neku's\nphone, too.\nThe camera.
Right.\nGot it.
......
Why did he\ndo it?
Why would\nhe want me\ndead?
He's trying to\njack Shibuya...
Do I play\ninto that?
That's crazy.\nWhat could\nI do?
I don't know\nhow to jack a\ntown!
Then again...\nHe made the\npact with me.
Did he kill me\njust so we could\npartner up?
......
If I want\nto ask, now's\nthe time...
Hey.
Why'd you\nmake a pact\nwith me?
Hmm?\nWhat's this,\nnow?
When we\nfirst met,
you said\nyou'd been\n[#FF0000]watching me[#000000].
What does\nthat mean?
Ahh.\nSo that's\nwhat this is\nall about.
Rrgh...
I've always\nbeen able to\nsee the UG.
This is the\nfreaky ability\nHanekoma\nmentioned?
Even when\nyou were\nalive?
That's right.\nLucky me,\nright?
I saw\nthings others\ncouldn't.
I knew about\nthe Game here\nin Shibuya.
I saw the\nPlayers.
Reapers, Noise...\nThe whole works.
So you were\nwatching me\nfrom the RG.
The Game\nintrigued\nme.
I was\nfollowing it on\nmy own when\nI met Mr. H.
When was\nthat?
Oh, years\nago.
So I became\na regular at his\nshop, listening to\nhis stories.
The more he\ntold me about\nthe UG,
the more\nI came to see\nits charm.
What charm?
People racing\nacross the city in\na life-or-death\nstruggle?
Find me\nanother rush\nlike that in\nShibuya.
Life for me\nwas one\ngiant bore.
Just the same\nthing, day after\nday...
Now THAT felt\nlike death.
So you...\ncame here?
Yeah.\nI decided I\nbelonged in\nthe UG.
......
And you\nthought I did,\ntoo?
...Hmm?
You want\nto be here?\nFine.
But not me!\nYou ki--
All done!
Really?\nLet's have\na look.
Dammit!
That do\nit before I\nhead out?
Oh?\nWhere are\nyou going?
Just a little\nerrand.
Shop's closed\nfor today.
Later,\nboys.
2-3, 2-3...
......
Well, the\ntracker's\nfixed.
Shall we?
Oh, before\nwe do...
Neku?
What?
My turn.
I suffered\nthrough your\nquestions,\ndidn't I?
Now I have\none for you.
...What?
How'd you\ndie, Neku?
What?
You tell me,\nass--
No.
...Two more\ndays.
He wants to\nplay it that\nway? Fine.
...I don't know.
Don't know?\nIs that even\npossible?
My memory\nwas the entry\nfee last Game.
Most of it's\nback, but...
there are still\na few holes.
What about\nyou?
How did\nyou die?
Hee hee...\nNot telling♪
Ugh, nice.
I'm here because\nI want to be.\nEnd of story.
Ready\nto go?
The questions\nbounce right\noff him.
I can't afford\nto get into a\nfight, though...
...Are you\nlistening,\nNeku?
The signal's\ncoming from\nthe scramble\ncrossing.
......
Yo, Phones.
Beat...
You man up\nany yet?
'Cause I\ndon't believe in\nhittin' women\nan' children.
Why are you\ndoing this?
You stupid?\nI'm a Reaper.
Don't be silly.\nReapers aren't\nallowed to--
\x22Reapers ain't\nallowed ta, Mommy!\nWah wah wah!\x22
Shut it!\nThis Reaper's\nhere to erase\nya!
Now bring\nit, yo!
Are you\ndaft!?
It's them!
Hey, no touchy,\nFreshmeat.\nRules are rules.
Reapers can't\nattack Players\nuntil Day 7--
and only the\nGame Master.
Yeah, and\nwe're all on\nstandby.
GM's\norders.
Leave the\nPlayers alone.
You may be new,\nFreshmeat, but\nyou can't just--
I'm special!
I'm runnin' a\nspecial op for the\nConductor, yo.
Special op!?
My, my!\nA rising star,\nare we?
Tha's right, Lolly.\nTwinkle twinkle.
Ugh! Why'd he\npick you?\nI have seniority!
Beats me.
Now you\nsenior citizens\ncan hobble\noff, aight?
Aaargh!\nCocky little\npunk!
C'mon, girl,\ntake it with\ndignity.
Let's leave\nthe kids in\npeace.
Have fun,\nFreshmeat.
Pfft, whatever.
Aight, Phones,\nle's dance!
Urg...\nNow that's\nmore like it.
Beat, stop!\nYou dropped--
I'ma drop\nYOU, hard!
Will you\nSTOP!?
This pendant\nis yours.
That's...\nHey!
Low blow,\nman!
You dropped\nit the other\nday, Beat.
Yeah, sure.\nNow gimme\nit back!
If you think\nyou can use\nthat to bargain,\nthink again, yo!
I'll pry it outta\nyour cold, dead\nhands!
No bargains!
Here.\nIt's yours.
...Why'd you\ngimme it?
We enemies,\nyo.
It's important\nto you, isn't it?
......
Hmph.\nDontchu be\nexpectin' any\nthanks.
...Bye, Beat.
Is the delinquent\nReaper gone?
Hmm...\nA special op...
What\nabout it?
Oh, nothing.\nLet's go.
This is CAT's\nlatest...
Shibuya's full\nof his stuff,\nhmm?
It must take\na ton of time.
I'm surprised\nhe keeps that\nsilly café open.
Huh?
CAT opened\na café?
Where?\nIn Shibuya?
You feeling all\nright, Neku?
How many times\nhave you been\nthere now?
What!?
Where the\nheck is it?
Cat Street,\nsilly.
Cat...
No way!
Yes, way.\nCAT is Mr. H.
NO WAY!
Mr. Hanekoma!?\nIs CAT!?
Whoa...whoa!\nOK, calm down.
Hee hee.\nI'll try.
Mr. H?\nSeriously?
I don't\nbelieve it!
How did you\nnot know this?
I thought you\nwere CAT's\nbiggest fan.
He never\ndoes interviews\nin person.
He's never\nreleased any\nphotos, either.
I never even\nknew he was\na \x22he\x22!
Man...\nMr. Hanekoma...
I can see it,\nthough.
From the\nfirst time I\nsaw him,
I knew he\nwas special.
Damn, I've\ntalked to CAT!
That is\nfreaking\nRAD!
Hee hee.\nI'm happy you're\nhappy.
Just don't tell\nhim where you\nheard, hmm?
I won't.
So, if\nHanekoma\nis CAT...
That means\nhe's...
CAT's\nNOT the\nComposer!
Joshua's\nlooking for the\nComposer.
Hanekoma's\nhelping him.
The Composer\nwouldn't be\nthat dumb.
Besides, Josh\nis too sharp\nnot to notice.
Guess I was\noverthinking\nthings.
CAT can't be\nthe Composer.
I still don't\nget why he's\nso popular.
It's just\nstreet art.
CAT's works\nall follow a\nsingle, consistent\naesthetic.
And he keeps\nthe quality up.
Most important,\nhis work speaks\nto people.
I see.
That's tougher\nthan it sounds.
Is it?\nI bet you'd\nhave little\ntrouble.
Huh?
Use your\nPlayer Pin.
What's this\ngot to do with--
If you know\nwhat people are\nthinking, it's easy\nto grab them.
It...
it would be\nan advantage.
Right.\nWhy bother\nwith talk?
With sifting\nthrough the lies\nwe all tell?
You could talk\ntill you're blue in\nthe face and not\nhear the truth.
And we all see\nthings differently\nanyway.
It's true.
We're not\nmeant to see\neye to eye.
But...
I dunno,\nmaybe it's better\nthat way.
Sure,\npeople don't\nthink alike.
We don't know\nwhat's going\nthrough the other\nguy's head.
But we can\nTRY to find\nout, right?
Expand our\nworlds through\neach other.
Maybe that's\na better way\nto go--
the real way\nto enjoy each\nmoment.
You OK,\nNeku?
Yeah, I could\ntry to be CAT\nwith this pin.
But why?
Where's the\nenjoyment in\nthat?
I'd rather\nbroaden my\nworld my own\nway.
......
Neku...
Hee hee,\nyour face is\npriceless.
Huh?
Who asked\nyou!?
Anyway, we\nreally should\nmake for the\nscramble.
We may\nnot be getting\nmissions,
but we still\nonly have so\nmuch time.
Him and his\nComposer\nhunt...
He's really\nserious?
Kid's crazy.\nHe's on his own.
Hold it.
I'm getting\na signal.
It's coming\nfrom--
Wait a\nminute.
You want to\ntake on the\nComposer.
Haven't we\nbeen over\nthis?
Look,\nI'm done\nwith it.
I have to win\nthis Game.
I'm not taking\non any more\nrisks.
......
Fine.
I won't ask\nyou to get\ninvolved.
At least let\nme pinpoint\nthe River.
......
OK, but\nthat's it.
Hee hee.\nYou're so\ngenerous.
The signal's\ncoming from\nthe station\nunderpass.
Wrong way,\nNeku.
The signal's\ngetting weaker.
...Here?
Looks like\nthe tracker's\nworking now.
Welcome to\nthe Shibuya\nRiver.
Since when\nis there a\nriver here?
That's news\nto me.
The Composer's\njust ahead.
......
......
...What?
We're\nblocked out.
This is\nthe end of\nthe line?
Unless we\nget rid of\nthat wall.
Let's head\nback and gather\nmore info.
Gather it\nwhere?
Who the\nhell'd know\nabout this?
We found\nyour river.
Satisfied?
For now.
What the...
Noise?
The same kind\nas before!
Get ready!
Did we\nkill it!?
Apparently\nnot...
Looks like we're\noutmatched.
Rrgh! I can't\ngive up now...
......
Oh, all right...
I was hoping\nto avoid this.
Holy...
Since when\ncan you do\nTHAT!?
I told you,\nI hate working\nup a sweat.
Braaa-vo!
Who's there!?
Afternoon,\nkids.
...Hey,\npretty boy.
You're ALIVE,\nain't ya?
What!?
That was one\nhelluva blast.
No way a\nPlayer could\ndo that.
You don't see\njuice like that\nin the UG.
You know,\nliving folks\naren't allowed\nin the Game.
That makes\nyou a rule-\nbreaker.
I could\nerase you\nright now.
No!
But...\nI won't.
Huh?
Too much\nwork.
'Sides, that\nNoise was givin'\nus hell, too.
So let's just\nsay I blinked.
Not next\ntime, though.
You'll be\nerased before\nyou know it.
...By Uzuki.
Later!
...Whew.
Lucky us,\nhuh, Neku?
Joshua...
Was that\ntrue?
You're alive?
......
Cat's out\nof the bag.
Yes, Neku.\nI'm playing the\nGame alive.
You're...\nBut how can...
There's a\nloophole to\neverything.
Sneaking in\nmeans I don't have\na Player Pin, \nbut such is life.
So you\njust--
Please,\nit's not a\nbig deal.
We formed\na valid pact.
We're just\nlike any other\npair, Neku.
...No.
Hmm?\nI didn't catch\nthat.
No, we're not,\nyou punk!
How can you\nsay you're the\nsame as us?\nYou're alive!
You're here\n'cause you\nwant to be!
Not us!
I don't want\nto be here!
I'm not playing\nthe Game for\nkicks, dammit!
No, you're\nplaying because\nyou want to\nlive again.
You still get\nsomething out\nof this.
You little\nbastard...
Only what\nyou TOOK\nfrom me!
YOU killed\nme!
Aww, Neku.
You said\nyou didn't\nremember!
You sneaky\nlittle thing.
Well?
So what\nif I did?
What!?
What if I am\nthe one who\nkilled you?
You're going\nto do something\nabout it?
HEY, BRO!
You slammin'?
Care to\nplay a round,\nNeku?
AWRIGHT!\nLet's do this!
Heh heh...\nI hand-design\nand build all\nmy pin mods.
It's Yammer\nTime!
Aww,\nbut bro...
I...\nI lost?
......
You're getting\ngood at this.
Heh!\nYou've got a\nways to go.
Rrgh...
But I'll replay\nyou any time!
Nooo!\nThat design\nshould've been\nperfect!
I totally\nretooled my\npins, too...
He cheated\nAGAIN?
Heh heh.\nThe Yammer\nspecial pwns!
Rrgh...
C'mon, bro!\nLet's SLAM!
Here to play\na round with\nthe boys?
WOW, bro!\nI'm impressed!
You've gotten\ngood at this!
Here, this\nis for you.
Let's slam\nagain soon!
Back at\nthe scramble\nagain...
One more\nday down.
Hey, where's...
Yeah, we\nfound it.
We just\ncan't get in.
On the phone...\nMr. H again?
Why would\nhe help this\nkid?
Does he\nknow Joshua\nkilled me?
All right.\nI'll call you.
Morning,\nsunshine.
Har har.
You're killing\nme, Josh.\nOh, wait...
Again, say it\nwas me.\nWhat are you\ngoing to do?
That's easy!\nI'll--
Erase me?
Don't tempt\nme.
Oh, please.
We're partners,\nyou and I.
If I go,\nyou're dead in\nthe water.
Rrgh!
You smug\nlittle piece\nof snot!
You knew\nthat going into\nall this!
You knew\nyou'd be safe\nif you made a\npact with me!
But why\nkill me in the\nfirst place?
You could\nhave picked\nanybody!
Why me!?
You don't\ncare about the\nGame or the\nmissions...
Just pushing\nalong your\nlittle agenda.
Gah!\nMail?
A mission!?
\x22Game VI:\nBeat the bosses\nof 2.2360679's\n0 + 5.
\x22θ = 60 min.\nIncompletes will\nbe destroyed.\x22
The bosses\nof 0 + 5...
Meaning\ntwo fights?
Is 2.23\nwhatever code\nfor something?
Let's leave\nthat for now.
First let's see\nwhere we have\naccess to.
You're sure\ninto this today.
What do you\ncare about\nmissions?
I care plenty,\nNeku.
I am a\nPlayer.
You're alive.
Maybe so,\nbut I'm still\na Player.
If I'm erased\nhere in the UG,\nthe RG me dies.
My stakes\nare just as high\nas yours.
Then why\nput yourself in\nthat danger?
Beats staying\nin the RG.
Now let's\ngo.
Wait.
Don't think\nfor a minute\nI've forgiven\nyou.
I'll put up with\nyou to clear\nthe mission.
That's all.
Hee hee.\nYes, sir.
Neku,\nlook out!
Wha--
Why'd that\nNoise attack?
Just like\nyesterday.
They attack\nwithout any\nprovocation.
Some new\nkind of Noise?
Behind you!
Hmm!?
Wh-what\njust happened?
......
It seems we\nowe someone\nfor saving us.
Who?
...Beat?
Either way,\nwe were lucky.
I shouldn't\nhave been so\ncareless.
Stay sharp\ntoday, Neku.
The Noise are\non the march.
Now--
let's see\nwhat roads\nare open.
What's up\nwith the Noise\ntoday?
They're\nacting so\nstrange...
There are\ngenerally two\ntypes of Noise.
Strays that\nemerge from\nnegative emotions\nin RG people,
and the ones\nReapers make to\nerase Players.
Strays won't\nattack Players,\nso...
The Grim\nHeaper's out\nfor blood?
Most likely.
Ugh.
Well, he can\nbring it on.
Let's go!
Gyaaah!
The hell is\nup with this\nNoise!?
Look!
A Reaper.
He's being\nattacked by\nNoise!
Well,\nNeku?
We've gotta\nhelp him!
If you\nsay so.
More!?
These'll have\nto come first.
He'll have\nto tough it\nout till then.
Rrgh!
Hurry!
Let's make a\nbreak for it.
Wise\nchoice.
That Reaper!\nWhere'd he...
Gone,\nI'm afraid.
We left him\nto die...
We did what\nwe had to,\nNeku.
......
Still...
Why was that\nNoise attacking\na Reaper?
Do Noise made\nby Reapers not\nattack them?
That's what I'd\nheard, anyway...
......
What the\nhell are these,\nthen?
Yeaaaugh!
......
That Reaper...\nHe's...
That's not\nyour concern,\nNeku.
Let's move\nalong.
No!
Nngh!
More of\n'em?
Sota, sorry...\nI can't...
Nao!\nStay with me!
We're finishing\nthis thing\ntogether!
I'd...\nlove to...
but it...\ndoesn't look\nlike I can.
Sorry...\nSota...
Nao!
Dammit...
DAMMIT!
Without a\npartner...
he won't be\nfar behind.
Well,\nNeku?
Do we help\nhim anyway?
......
You have\nto ask!?
Let's go!
Nngh!
Nao...
Looks like I\nwon't be far\nbehind ya.
Huh?\nAren't you--
We'll handle\nthis!
C'mon,\nJoshua!
I'm ready.
We have\nto keep...\nUrg, no!!!
I can't just\nleave him!
Nngh!
Nao...
Looks like I\nwon't be far\nbehind ya.
Huh?\nAren't you--
We'll handle\nthis!
C'mon,\nJoshua!
I'm ready.
You OK?
Yeah...
You saved\nmy ass.
Heh, for now,\nanyway.
I lost\nNao...
I don't have\nmuch longer.
Nngh...
If...
if we'd gotten\nhere sooner--
Ain't your\nfault, dawg.
I wasn't\nstrong enough.\nEnd of story.
Neku and\nJoshua,\nright?
Yeah.
You two\nsurvive.
Get your\nold partner\nback.
I hope all\nthree of ya get\nback safe.
Augh!!!\nWe were too\nlate!
They were\nright there,\nbut...
I couldn't\ndo a thing.
We may be\nthe last pair.
Let's stay\nsharp.
Friggin'\nReapers!
Angry?
Hell yes,\nI'm angry!
At least\nyou're still in\nthe Game.
Yeah? What\nabout the people\nwho aren't?
Screw the Game!\nThese are people,\nnot toys!
Why the\nsudden\ninterest?
I didn't\nthink you cared\nabout other\nPlayers.
No...
No what?
Sure, other\nPlayers are\nstrangers.
Not just\nPlayers.
Everyone.
I don't know\nwho they are,\nwhere they're\nfrom, what they\ncare about.
But...
since I\ncame to the\nUG, I...
I've talked\nwith them\na little.
Got to know\nthem a little.
Felt them\na little...
Felt my\nworld grow.
Just a tiny,\ntiny bit.
It's different\nnow.
They're\nnot just some\nstrangers.
I can't\nshut them out\nlike that.
My, my.
This isn't like\nyou at all.
Well, just\ndon't get your\nhopes up.
You'll never\nreally understand\nthe people\naround you.
Enjoy the\nmoment.
Hmm?
Enjoying\nyour world\nmeans making\nit bigger.
I finally\nget that.
The world\nas one person\nsees it is tiny.
You've\ngotta...
gotta reach\nout to other\npeople.
......
Hee hee.
Maybe so.
Only by allowing\nstrangers in
can we find\nnew ways to be\nourselves.
It's possible.
Now, are\nyou ready?
It looks like\nthis mission's\nup to us.
Looks like\nRoute 5's the\nonly one open.
Route 5?
From the\nscramble crossing\nout to Udagawa.
So that\n2.2 number...
2.2360679.
It's the\nsquare root\nof 5.
Ugh, Pi-Face\nand his lame\njokes.
So what's\nthe 0 + 5?
Route 5\nspans a total\nof six areas.
The scramble,\nCenter Street,\nAMX,
Tipsy Tose Hall,\nShibu-Q Heads,\nand Udagawa.
Assuming\nthe scramble\nis 0...
Udagawa\nwould be 5.
Precisely.
Problem\nsolved.
Our targets\nare the bosses\nof the scramble\nand Udagawa.
All right.\nLet's get this\nmission done.
Next stop,\nUdagawa!
Them,\ntoo!?
Huff...huff...
Still with\nme?
Where the\nhell did these\nTaboo Noise\ncome from?
Game Master\nmusta cooked\n'em up.
And sent\nthem out after\nus Reapers?
What is he,\ncrazy!?
Incoming,\nUzuki!
They're\nhaving a rough\ntime of it.
......
Well,\nNeku?
Do we\nsend in the\ncavalry?
Let's do it.\nThey'll hate it.
You're so\nvindictive.
We can't risk it.\nLet's run.
This is\ngetting ugly...
Kariya, we're\npulling out!
Yes,\nma'am!
You guys\nOK?
You two...
Why'd you\nhelp us?
Are you,\nlike, stupid?
We're your\nenemies.\nHello?
Seriously.
We can\ntake care of\nourselves!
Whew!\nYou guys saved\nour butts.
We were\neight kinds of\nboned.
What?\nKariya!
Enemy or not,\nif somebody\nhelps you, you\nsay thanks.
Ugh,\nwhatever.
I didn't\nask for your\nhelp!
Just thinking\nabout it\nmakes me want\nto barf.
A Reaper\nneeding a Player\nto save them?
Seriously,\ngag!
We're leaving,\nKariya!
Two simple\nwords. Is it\nthat hard?
She'd rather\nhave been\nNoise food?
Maybe \x22barf\x22\nis her version of\n\x22thank you.\x22
Let's get\nmoving.
We're here.
What's the\ntime?
Thirty\nminutes left.
Piece of\ncake.
Let's wreck\nthis thing!
Mission\ncleared.
Hang in\nthere, Shiki.\nOne more\nday...
Heh heh heh...
Zetta fun\ntimes.
Zetta...
Nrrgh!\nMy head...\nagain...
Hee hee.\nWhy, hello\nthere.
Bored again?
Or maybe\njust lonely.
Can't have\nyou 2 dying\non me.
My calculations'd\ngo haywire.
I'd lose all\nmotivation to\ncreate.
Glad\nyou pulled\nthrough.
Glad?\nWhy would\nhe be glad?
Ahh!
So you were\nthe mystery\nhelper in the\nfirst fight.
Thanks\nfor that.
Anyone too\nweak to beat a\n000 like that\nis garbage.
CRUNCH!
He...\nhelped us?
Remember what\ntomorrow is?
Day 7!\nThat magical day\nwhen I get to go\nhands-on.
Time for a\nlittle quiz.
How fast will\nI erase you?
Not too fast,\nI hope.
299,792,458 m/s!
What?
The speed\nof light?
I'll correct the\ndeviation that\nsaved you last time\nwe met here.
This time,\nyou're a dead\nman.
The pain's\nfading...
Are he and I\nconnected or\nsomething?
Tomorrow\nwon't be fun.
I can only\nimagine what\nhe'll try.
\x22Last time\x22?
What did\nhe mean by\nthat?
Was he talking\nto Joshua?
He does seem\nto be Pi-Face's\ntarget.
So the two\nof them faced\neach other\nhere before...
When?
I can't blame\nanybody for\nwanting to whack\nthis kid...
But he'll\nhave to get\nin line.
Once\ntomorrow's\ndone...
That concludes\nYashiro's\nreport.
So the Taboo\nNoise were\nMinamimoto's\ndoing.
This is grave\ntreason, sir.
Allow me\nto handle\nMinamimoto.
No need.
I'll discuss his\npunishment with\nthe Composer.
Your input is\nnot required.
...Understood.
However,\nthis is a matter\nof urgency.
I hope you'll\nreach a conclusion\nswiftly.
Next, the\nmatter of the\nillegal Player.
May I take\naction there?
Or would\nyou prefer to\ndiscuss--
You may.
The rules\nare very\nclear.
Yes, sir.
One closing\nremark--
A certain Player\nhas exhibited\ngreat resilience.
Neku Sakuraba.\nWhat do you\nmake of him?
...Heh.\nSakuraba,\nof course!
Just when I\nthought I had\nHim figured\nout!
HEY, BRO!
You slammin'?
Care to\nplay a round,\nNeku?
Awright!\nLet's do this!
Heh heh...\nI hand-design\nand build all\nmy pin mods.
It's Yammer\nTime!
Aww,\nbut bro...
I...\nI lost?
......
You're getting\ngood at this.
Heh!\nYou've got a\nways to go.
Rrgh...
But I'll replay\nyou any time!
Nooo!\nThat design\nshould've been\nperfect!
I totally\nretooled my\npins, too...
He cheated\nAGAIN?
Heh heh.\nThe Yammer\nspecial pwns!
Rrgh...
HEY, BRO!
You slammin'?
Here to play\na round with\nthe boys?
BRO!
Let's SLAM!
Want to play\nanother round\nbefore you go?
What, they're\ngoing to keep\ntrying till they\nwin?
If this is\nhow they want\nto play it...
I'll just\nhave to crush\nthem.
Ready,\nYammer?
Super team\nattack, GO!
Roger that,\nShooter!
I'll win any\nway I can!
How could\nwe lose!?
He's good...
WOW, bro....
You're a\nworthy rival!
Here, take\nthese!
And be\nready to LOSE\nnext time!
Ha ha!\nSo close...
and yet so\nfar away!
Rrgh...
HEY, BRO!
You slammin'?
Here to play\na round with\nthe boys?
Day 7...
Indeed.
Kind of\na shame.
We never found\na way into the\nShibuya River.
Joshua...
Why'd you\nkill me?
I killed\nwho, now?
Drop it,\nJosh.
You said it\nyourself.
I just asked\nwhat you'd do\nif I had.
Look, did\nyou or--
Rrgh...\nThe mission.
When we're\nthrough with this,\nyou're telling\nme everything.
Hee hee.\nWhatever you\nsay, Neku.
\x22Game 7:\nErase the\nGame Master at\nPork City.
\x22time = 600\nminutes.\nIncompletes will\nbe erased.\x22
Nngh...
Well, this\nis it.
Just us\nand the Grim\nHeaper.
......
What?
This mission\nseems odd.
Ah, well.
No sense\nin worrying\nabout it.
Shall we\nhead to\nPork City?
That's past\nDogenzaka.
Let's go.
After you.
Durff!
A wall...
Looks like\nit's Pork City\nor nowhere.
Hmm?\nAnother mail?
\x22P.S. Have\ncow and mouse\non hand.\x22
\x22P.S.\x22?
That's a\nfirst.
......
This entire\nmission seems\nodd.
Yeah...
It is a bit\ndifferent.
No riddles.
No weird\nnumbers.
......
Now this\nall of a\nsudden...
Think it's\na trap?
Who can\nsay?
Though\nI have my\nguesses.
Hee hee.\nAll we can do\nis play along.
We can't\nwin if we don't\ncomplete the\nmission.
Right.
Hmm...\nCow and\nmouse...
The heck\ndoes that\nmean?
Hey!\nIt's you guys!
Perfect\ntiming!
Ugh, not more\nerrands...
I say we\nrun for it.
Another\nwall!?
Hey, c'mon!\nDon't bail.
I wanted to\ngive you this,
for your\nhelp before.
I dunno,\nmaybe you'll\nfind a use\nfor it.
Uh,\nthanks.
Did you\nfind your\nmicrophone?
......
'Fraid not.
I'm sorry to\nhear that.
But it's\ncool.
We've got a\nnew one!
We're gonna\nbust outta the\nindie circuit with\nthis baby.
Blow a hole\nin the freakin'\nmusic scene!
Anyhow, that's\nit from us.
See ya!
They're going\nmajor with that\nmegaphone?
Hee hee.
I'd like to\nsee that\nconcert.
No joke.
What the\nheck kinda\nmusic are\nthey making?
This is where\nhe's hiding?
It's a good\nspot for it.
How's that?
All the stray\nthoughts in\nShibuya flow\nthrough here.

They hit\nPork City and\nrise up above\nthe city...
then come\ncrashing back\ndown again.
Always\nbuilding, never\nlessening...
And he's\nsitting on top\nof it all?
Smug\nbastard.
Attention seekers\ndo tend to favor\nhigh places.
That's him\nall right.
I just\nneed to take\nhim out.
Sit tight,\nShiki.
Players?\nHere?
Uhh, yeah?
That's the\nmission.
Erase the\nGame Master\nhere in Pork\nCity.
......
You hear\nanything about\nthis, man?
Nope.
Mr. Minamimoto\ntold us to guard\nthis spot.
That was\nsix boring\ndays ago.
......
Well?\nWhat do you\nthink?
They're here\non a mission,\nright?
Why not do\nthe usual?
Makes\nsense...
If they're\nhere on a\nmission,
that means\nMr. Minamimoto\nwants 'em here.
OK. Meet my\nterms and you\ncan pass.
Players!?
Why are\nthey here?
Again?
We're here\nfor the mission,\nthanks.
......
What\nmission?
I dunno.
But the guys\ndownstairs let\n'em through.
OK. Meet my\nterms and you\ncan go on up.
But don't\nexpect it to\nbe easy.
This place\nis a little\nspecial, see?
Erasing Noise\nhere is tricky.
If you\nwant to burn\nthrough 'em...
pick\nyour brands\ncarefully.
OK, so you\npassed the\nfirst floor.
That doesn't\nmean you'll get\nthrough here.
If you wanna\nsurvive here...
pick\nyour brands\ncarefully.
Neku, are\nall your pins\nin order?
I suspect he's\njust ahead.
I should put\nmy A-list pins\nback on.
Hey...\nDoes fighting\nhere seem odd\nto you?
Why do we\nwind up in that\nweird black and\nwhite space?
I don't really\nknow...
It could be the\nimaginary number\nplane Mr. H told\nme about.
Imaginary\nwhat?
A parallel plane\na fraction away\nfrom the world\nNoise inhabit.
We may\nbe fighting\nthere.
That Pi-Face's\nwork?
Probably.
But even\nso...
Pork City\nis kind of an\nexception to\nbegin with.
He may just\nbe directing its\nnatural energy.
Wonderful.
Hee hee.\nThis IS his base,\nafter all.
Not for\nlong.
Let's head\nupstairs\nand beat him\ndown.
Nngh!?\nYou two?
How'd you find\nthis place!?
